<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM
SIKES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Oliver awoke in the morning he was
a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of
shoes with strong thick soles had been placed
at his bedside, and that his old ones had been
removed. At first he was pleased with the
discovery, hoping that it might be the forerunner
of his release; but such thoughts were
quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast
alone with the Jew, who told him, in a
tone and manner which increased his alarm,
that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill
Sikes that night.</p>

<p>“To—to—stop there, sir?” asked Oliver,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no, my dear, not to stop there,” replied
the Jew. “We shouldn’t like to lose
you. Don’t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come
back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We wont be
so cruel as to send you away, my dear. Oh no,
no!”</p>

<p>The old man, who was stooping over the fire
toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he
bantered Oliver thus, and chuckled as if to shew
that he knew he would still be very glad to get
away if he could.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said the Jew, fixing his eyes on
Oliver, “you want to know what you’re going
to Bill’s for—eh, my dear?”</p>

<p>Oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the
old thief had been reading his thoughts; but
boldly said, “Yes, he did want to know.”</p>

<p>“Why, do you think?” inquired Fagin, parrying
the question.</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“Bah!” said the Jew, turning away with a
disappointed countenance from a close perusal
of the boy’s face. “Wait till Bill tells you,
then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver’s
not expressing any greater curiosity on the
subject; but the truth is, that, although he felt
very anxious, he was too much confused by the
earnest cunning of Fagin’s looks, and his own
speculations, to make any further inquiries just
then. He had no other opportunity; for the
Jew remained very surly and silent till night,
when he prepared to go abroad.</p>

<p>“You may burn a candle,” said the Jew,
putting one upon the table; “and here’s a book
for you to read till they come to fetch you.
Good night!”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir!” replied Oliver, softly.</p>

<p>The Jew walked to the door, looking over his
shoulder at the boy as he went, and, suddenly
stopping, called him by his name.</p>

<p>Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the
candle, motioned him to light it. He did so;
and, as he placed the candlestick upon the
table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at
him with lowering and contracted brows from
the dark end of the room.</p>

<p>“Take heed, Oliver! take heed!” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
old man, shaking his right hand before him in
a warning manner. “He’s a rough man,
and thinks nothing of blood when his own is
up. Whatever falls out, say nothing, and do
what he bids you. Mind!” Placing a strong
emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features
gradually to resolve themselves into a
ghastly grin; and, nodding his head, left the
room.</p>

<p>Oliver leant his head upon his hand when
the old man disappeared, and pondered with a
trembling heart on the words he had just heard.
The more he thought of the Jew’s admonition,
the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose
and meaning. He could think of no bad
object to be attained by sending him to Sikes
which would not be equally well answered by
his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating
for a long time, concluded that he had been
selected to perform some ordinary menial offices
for the housebreaker, until another boy better
suited for his purpose could be engaged. He
was too well accustomed to suffering, and had
suffered too much where he was, to bewail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the prospect of a change very severely. He
remained lost in thought for some minutes, and
then with a heavy sigh snuffed the candle, and
taking up the book which the Jew had left with
him, began to read.</p>

<p>He turned over the leaves carelessly at first,
but, lighting on a passage which attracted his
attention, soon became intent upon the volume.
It was a history of the lives and trials of great
criminals, and the pages were soiled and
thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful
crimes that make the blood run cold; of secret
murders that had been committed by the lonely
wayside, and bodies hidden from the eye of
man in deep pits and wells, which would not
keep them down, deep as they were, but had
yielded them up at last, after many years, and
so maddened the murderers with the sight, that
in their horror they had confessed their guilt,
and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.
Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their
beds at dead of night, had been tempted and led
on by their own bad thoughts to such dreadful
bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
limbs quail to think of. The terrible descriptions
were so real and vivid, that the sallow
pages seemed to turn red with gore, and the
words upon them to be sounded in his ears as
if they were whispered in hollow murmurs by
the spirits of the dead.</p>

<p>In a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the
book and thrust it from him. Then, falling
upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him
from such deeds, and rather to will that he
should die at once, than be reserved for crimes
so fearful and appalling. By degrees he grew
more calm, and besought in a low and broken
voice that he might be rescued from his present
dangers, and that if any aid were to be raised
up for a poor outcast boy, who had never known
the love of friends or kindred, it might come to
him now, when, desolate and deserted, he
stood alone in the midst of wickedness and
guilt.</p>

<p>He had concluded his prayer, but still remained
with his head buried in his hands, when
a rustling noise aroused him.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” he cried, starting up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
catching sight of a figure standing by the door.
“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Me—only me,” replied a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>Oliver raised the candle above his head, and
looked towards the door. It was Nancy.</p>

<p>“Put down the light,” said the girl, turning
away her head; “it hurts my eyes.”</p>

<p>Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently
inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself
into a chair, with her back towards him, and
wrung her hands; but made no reply.</p>

<p>“God forgive me!” she cried after a while,
“I never thought of all this.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Oliver,
“Can I help you? I will if I can; I will, indeed.”</p>

<p>She rocked herself to and fro, caught her
throat, and, uttering a gurgling sound, struggled
and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>“Nancy!” cried Oliver, greatly alarmed,
“What is it?”</p>

<p>The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and
her feet upon the ground, and, suddenly stopping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
drew her shawl close round her, and
shivered with cold.</p>

<p>Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair
close to it, she sat there for a little time without
speaking, but at length she raised her head, and
looked round.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what comes over me sometimes,”
said the girl, affecting to busy herself
in arranging her dress; “it’s this damp, dirty
room, I think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you
ready?”</p>

<p>“Am I to go with you?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have come from Bill,” replied the
girl. “You are to go with me.”</p>

<p>“What for?” said Oliver, recoiling.</p>

<p>“What for!” echoed the girl, raising her
eyes, and averting them again the moment
they encountered the boy’s face. “Oh! for no
harm.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Oliver, who had
watched her closely.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” rejoined the girl,
affecting to laugh. “For no good, then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver could see that he had some power
over the girl’s better feelings, and for an instant
thought of appealing to her compassion on his
helpless state. But then the thought darted
across his mind that it was barely eleven o’clock,
and that many people were still in the streets, of
whom surely some might be found to give credence
to his tale. As the reflection occurred to
him, he stepped forward, and said somewhat
hastily that he was ready.</p>

<p>Neither his brief consideration nor its purport
were lost upon his companion. She eyed
him narrowly while he spoke, and cast upon
him a look of intelligence which sufficiently
shewed that she guessed what had been passing
in his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said the girl, stooping over him,
and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously
round. “You can’t help yourself. I
have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose.
You are hedged round and round, and if ever
you are to get loose from here, this is not the
time.”</p>

<p>Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
looked up in her face with great surprise. She
seemed to speak the truth; her countenance
was white and agitated, and she trembled with
very earnestness.</p>

<p>“I have saved you from being ill-used once,
and I will again, and I do now,” continued the
girl aloud; “for those who would have fetched
you, if I had not, would have been far more
rough than me. I have promised for your
being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will
only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps
be my death. See here! I have borne all
this for you already, as true as God sees me
shew it.”</p>

<p>She pointed hastily to some livid bruises
upon her neck and arms, and continued with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>“Remember this, and don’t let me suffer
more for you just now. If I could help you I
would, but I have not the power. They don’t
mean to harm you, and whatever they make
you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! every
word from you is a blow for me. Give me your
hand—make haste, your hand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively
placed in hers, and, blowing out the light,
drew him after her up the stairs. The door
was opened quickly by some one shrouded in
the darkness, and as quickly closed when they
had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in
waiting; and, with the same vehemence which
she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the
girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains
close. The driver wanted no directions,
but lashed his horse into full speed without the
delay of an instant.</p>

<p>The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand,
and continued to pour into his ear the warnings
and assurances she had already imparted. All
was so quick and hurried that he had scarcely
time to recollect where he was, or how he came
there, when the carriage stopped at the same
house to which the Jew’s steps had been
directed on the previous evening.</p>

<p>For one brief moment Oliver cast a hurried
glance along the empty street, and a cry for
help hung upon his lips. But the girl’s voice
was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
agony to remember her, that he had not the
heart to utter it; while he hesitated, the opportunity
was gone, for he was already in the
house, and the door was shut.</p>

<p>“This way,” said the girl, releasing her hold
for the first time. “Bill!”</p>

<p>“Hallo!” replied Sikes, appearing at the
head of the stairs with a candle. “Oh! that’s
the time of day. Come on!”</p>

<p>This was a very strong expression of approbation,
and an uncommonly hearty welcome
from a person of Mr. Sikes’s temperament.
Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted
him cordially.</p>

<p>“Bullseye’s gone home with Tom,” observed
Sikes, as he lighted them up. “He’d have been
in the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” rejoined Nancy.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got the kid,” said Sikes, when
they had all reached the room: closing the door
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, here he is,” replied Nancy.</p>

<p>“Did he come quiet?” inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>“Like a lamb,” rejoined Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” said Sikes, looking
grimly at Oliver, “for the sake of his young
carcase, as would otherways have suffered for
it. Come here, young un, and let me read
you a lectur’, which is as well got over at
once.”</p>

<p>Thus addressing his new <i>protégé</i>, Mr. Sikes
pulled off his cap and threw it into a corner;
and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself
down by the table, and stood Oliver in front
of him.</p>

<p>“Now first, do you know wot this is?” inquired
Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which
lay on the table.</p>

<p>Oliver replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Well then, look here,” continued Sikes.
“This is powder, that ’ere’s a bullet, and this
is a little bit of a old hat for waddin’.”</p>

<p>Oliver murmured his comprehension of the
different bodies referred to, and Mr. Sikes proceeded
to load the pistol with great nicety and
deliberation.</p>

<p>“Now it’s loaded,” said Mr. Sikes, when he
had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I see it is, sir,” replied Oliver, trembling.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the robber, grasping Oliver’s
wrist tightly, and putting the barrel so close to
his temple that they touched, at which moment
the boy could not repress a shriek; “if you
speak a word when you’re out o’doors with me,
except when I speak to you, that loading will
be in your head without notice—so, if you <i>do</i>
make up your mind to speak without leave, say
your prayers first.”</p>

<p>Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of
this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes
continued,—</p>

<p>“As near as I know, there is’nt anybody as
would be asking very partickler arter you, if
you <i>was</i> disposed of; so I needn’t take this
devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to
you if it warn’t for your own good. D’ye
hear me?”</p>

<p>“The short and the long of what you mean,”
said Nancy, speaking very emphatically, and
slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his
serious attention to her words, “is, that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you’re crossed by him in this job you have on
hand, you’ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards
by shooting him through the head, and
take your chance of swinging for it as you do
for a great many other things in the way of
business every month of your life.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly;
“women can always put things in
fewest words, except when it’s blowing up, and
then they lengthens it out. And now that he’s
thoroughly up to it, let’s have some supper, and
get a snooze afore starting.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly
laid the cloth, and, disappearing for a few
minutes, presently returned with a pot of porter
and a dish of sheep’s heads, which gave occasion
to several pleasant witticisms on the part
of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence
of “jemmies” being a cant name common
to them and an ingenious implement much
used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy
gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate
prospect of being in active service, was in
great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
it may be here remarked that he humorously
drank all the beer at a draught, and did not
utter, on a rough calculation, more than fourscore
oaths during the whole progress of the
meal.</p>

<p>Supper being ended—it may be easily conceived
that Oliver had no great appetite for it—Mr.
Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of
spirits and water, and threw himself upon the
bed, ordering Nancy, with many imprecations
in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.
Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command
of the same authority, on a mattress
upon the floor; and the girl mending the fire,
sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the
appointed time.</p>

<p>For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it
not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity
of whispering some further advice;
but the girl sat brooding over the fire without
moving, save now and then to trim the light.
Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length
fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the table was covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various
articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which
hung over the back of a chair, while Nancy was
busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was
not yet daylight, for the candle was still burning,
and it was quite dark outside. A sharp
rain, too, was beating against the window-panes,
and the sky looked black and cloudy.</p>

<p>“Now, then!” growled Sikes, as Oliver
started up; “half-past five! Look sharp, or
you’ll get no breakfast, for it’s late as it is.”</p>

<p>Oliver was not long in making his toilet;
and, having taken some breakfast, replied to a
surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was
quite ready.</p>

<p>Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw
him a handkerchief to tie round his throat, and
Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button
over his shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his
hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to
shew him, with a menacing gesture, that he had
the pistol in a side pocket of his great-coat,
clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell
with Nancy, led him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver turned for an instant when they
reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look
from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat
in front of the fire, and sat perfectly motionless
before it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>THE EXPEDITION.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a cheerless morning when they got
into the street, blowing and raining hard, and
the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night
had been very wet, for large pools of water had
collected in the road and the kennels were overflowing.
There was a faint glimmering of the
coming day in the sky, but it rather aggravated
than relieved the gloom of the scene, the sombre
light only serving to pale that which the street-lamps
afforded, without shedding any warmer
or brighter tints upon the wet housetops and
dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody
stirring in that quarter of the town, for the
windows of the houses were all closely shut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the streets through which they passed
were noiseless and empty.</p>

<p>By the time they had turned into the Bethnal
Green road, the day had fairly begun to break.
Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a
few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards
London; and now and then a stagecoach,
covered with mud, rattled briskly by, the driver
bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash
upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on
the wrong side of the road, had endangered his
arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after
his time. The public-houses, with gas-lights
burning inside, were already open. By degrees
other shops began to be unclosed, and a few
scattered people were met with. Then came
straggling groups of labourers going to their
work; then men and women with fish-baskets
on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables,
chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole
carcasses of meat; milkwomen with pails; and an
unbroken concourse of people trudging out with
various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the
town. As they approached the City, the noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and traffic gradually increased; and when they
threaded the streets between Shoreditch and
Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound
and bustle. It was as light as it was likely to
be till night came on again, and the busy morning
of half the London population had begun.</p>

<p>Turning down Sun-street and Crown-street,
and crossing Finsbury-square, Mr. Sikes struck,
by way of Chiswell-street, into Barbican, thence
into Long-lane, and so into Smithfield, from
which latter place arose a tumult of discordant
sounds that filled Oliver Twist with surprise
and amazement.</p>

<p>It was market-morning. The ground was
covered nearly ankle-deep with filth and mire;
and a thick steam perpetually rising from the
reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with
the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops,
hung heavily above. All the pens in
the centre of the large area, and as many temporary
ones as could be crowded into the vacant
space, were filled with sheep; and tied up to
posts by the gutter side were long lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
beasts and oxen three or four deep. Countrymen,
butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves,
idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were
mingled together in a dense mass; the whistling
of drovers, the barking of dogs, the bellowing
and plunging of beasts, the bleating of sheep,
and grunting and squeaking of pigs; the cries
of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling
on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of
voices that issued from every public-house; the
crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping,
and yelling; the hideous and discordant din
that resounded from every corner of the market;
and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty
figures constantly running to and fro, and
bursting in and out of the throng, rendered it
a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite
confounded the senses.</p>

<p>Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed
his way through the thickest of the crowd, and
bestowed very little attention upon the numerous
sights and sounds which so astonished the
boy. He nodded twice or thrice to a passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
friend, and, resisting as many invitations to
take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward
until they were clear of the turmoil, and had
made their way through Hosier-lane into Holborn.</p>

<p>“Now, young un!” said Sikes surlily, looking
up at the clock of St. Andrew’s church,
“hard upon seven! you must step out. Come,
don’t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a
fierce jerk at his little companion’s wrist; and
Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot,
between a fast walk and a run, kept up with
the rapid strides of the housebreaker as well as
he could.</p>

<p>They kept on their course at this rate until
they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were
on their way to Kensington, when Sikes relaxed
his pace until an empty cart which was at
some little distance behind, came up: when,
seeing “Hounslow” written upon it, he asked
the driver, with as much civility as he could
assume, if he would give them a lift as far as
Isleworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jump up,” said the man. “Is that your
boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s my boy,” replied Sikes, looking
hard at Oliver, and putting his hand
abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol
was.</p>

<p>“Your father walks rather too quick for you,
don’t he, my man?” inquired the driver, seeing
that Oliver was out of breath.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes, interposing.
“He’s used to it. Here, take hold of my hand,
Ned. In with you!”</p>

<p>Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into
the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of
sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.</p>

<p>As they passed the different milestones,
Oliver wondered more and more where his
companion meant to take him. Kensington,
Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford,
were all passed; and yet they kept on as
steadily as if they had only begun their journey.
At length they came to a public-house called
the Coach and Horses, a little way beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
which another road appeared to turn off. And
here the cart stopped.</p>

<p>Sikes dismounted with great precipitation,
holding Oliver by the hand all the while;
and, lifting him down directly, bestowed a
furious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket
with his fist in a very significant
manner.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, boy,” said the man.</p>

<p>“He’s sulky,” replied Sikes, giving him a
shake; “he’s sulky,—a young dog! Don’t
mind him.”</p>

<p>“Not I!” rejoined the other, getting into his
cart. “It’s a fine day, after all.” And he
drove away.</p>

<p>Sikes waited till he had fairly gone, and then,
telling Oliver he might look about him if he
wanted, once again led him forward on his
journey.</p>

<p>They turned round to the left a short way
past the public-house, and then, taking a right-hand
road, walked on for a long time, passing
many large gardens and gentlemen’s houses on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing
but a little beer, until they reached a town, in
which, against the wall of a house, Oliver saw
written up in pretty large letters, “Hampton.”
Here they lingered about in the fields for some
hours. At length, they came back into the
town, and keeping on, past a public-house
which bore the sign of the Red Lion, and by
the river-side for a short distance, they came to
an old public-house with a defaced sign-board,
and ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room,
with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling,
and benches with high backs to them by
the fire, on which were seated several rough
men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking.
They took no notice of Oliver, and very little
of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice
of them, he and his young comrade sat in a
corner by themselves, without being much troubled
by the company.</p>

<p>They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat
here so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver
began to feel quite certain they were not going
any further. Being much tired with the
walk and getting up so early, he dozed a
little at first, and then, quite overpowered
by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when he was awakened
by a push from Sikes. Rousing himself sufficiently
to sit up and look about him, he
found that worthy in close fellowship and communication
with a labouring man, over a pint
of ale.</p>

<p>“So, you’re going on to Lower Halliford, are
you?” inquired Sikes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” replied the man, who seemed a
little the worse—or better, as the case might be—for
drinking; “and not slow about it neither.
My horse hasn’t got a load behind him going
back, as he had coming up in the mornin’, and
he wont be long a-doing of it. Here’s luck to
him! Ecod! he’s a good un!”</p>

<p>“Could you give my boy and me a lift as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
as there?” demanded Sikes, pushing the ale
towards his new friend.</p>

<p>“If you’re going directly, I can,” replied the
man, looking out of the pot. “Are you going
to Halliford?”</p>

<p>“Going on to Shepperton,” replied Sikes.</p>

<p>“I’m your man as far as I go,” replied the
other. “Is all paid, Becky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the other gentleman’s paid,” replied
the girl.</p>

<p>“I say!” said the man, with tipsy gravity,
“that wont do, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” rejoined Sikes. “You’re a-going
to accommodate us, and wot’s to prevent
my standing treat for a pint or so, in
return?”</p>

<p>The stranger reflected upon this argument
with a very profound face, and having done so,
seized Sikes by the hand, and declared he was
a real good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied,
he was joking;—as if he had been sober, there
would have been strong reason to suppose he
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>After the exchange of a few more compliments,
they bade the company good night, and
went out, the girl gathering up the pots and
glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the
door, with her hands full, to see the party
start.</p>

<p>The horse, whose health had been drunk in
his absence, was standing outside, ready harnessed
to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in
without any further ceremony, and the man, to
whom he belonged, having lingered a minute or
two “to bear him up,” and to defy the hostler
and the world to produce his equal, mounted
also. Then the hostler was told to give the
horse his head, and, his head being given him,
he made a very unpleasant use of it, tossing it
into the air with great disdain, and running into
the parlour windows over the way; after performing
which feats, and supporting himself for
a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at
great speed, and rattled out of the town right
gallantly.</p>

<p>The night was very dark. A damp mist
rose from the river and the marshy ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
about, and spread itself over the dreary fields.
It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and
black. Not a word was spoken, for the driver
had grown sleepy, and Sikes was in no mood to
lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled
together in a corner of the cart, bewildered with
alarm and apprehension, and figuring strange
objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches
waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic
joy at the desolation of the scene.</p>

<p>As they passed Sunbury church, the clock
struck seven. There was a light in the ferry-house
window opposite, which streamed across
the road, and threw into more sombre shadow
a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it. There
was a dull sound of falling water not far off,
and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in
the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for
the repose of the dead.</p>

<p>Sunbury was passed through, and they came
again into the lonely road. Two or three miles
more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted,
and, taking Oliver by the hand, they once again
walked on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>They turned into no house at Shepperton, as
the weary boy had expected, but still kept
walking on, in mud and darkness, through
gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until
they came within sight of the lights of a town
at no great distance. On looking intently forward,
Oliver saw that the water was just below
them, and that they were coming to the foot of
a bridge.</p>

<p>Sikes kept straight on till they were close
upon the bridge, and then turned suddenly
down a bank upon the left. “The water!”
thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. “He
has brought me to this lonely place to murder
me!”</p>

<p>He was about to throw himself on the
ground, and make one struggle for his young
life, when he saw that they stood before a
solitary house, all ruinous and decayed. There
was a window on each side of the dilapidated
entrance, and one story above; but no light
was visible. It was dark, dismantled, and, to
all appearance, uninhabited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Sikes, with Oliver’s hand still in his, softly
approached the low porch, and raised the latch.
The door yielded to the pressure, and they
passed in together.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>THE BURGLARY.</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Hallo!</span>” cried a loud, hoarse voice, directly
they had set foot in the passage.</p>

<p>“Don’t make such a row,” said Sikes, bolting
the door. “Shew a glim, Toby.”</p>

<p>“Aha! my pal,” cried the same voice; “a
glim, Barney, a glim! Shew the gentleman in,
Barney; and wake up first, if convenient.”</p>

<p>The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack,
or some such article, at the person he addressed,
to rouse him from his slumbers; for the noise
of a wooden body falling violently was heard,
and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man
between asleep and awake.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” cried the same voice.
“There’s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody
to do the civil to him; and you sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
there, as if you took laudanum with your
meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any
fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick
to wake you thoroughly?”</p>

<p>A pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across
the bare floor of the room as this interrogatory
was put; and there issued from a door on the
right hand, first a feeble candle, and next, the
form of the same individual who has been heretofore
described as labouring under the infirmity
of speaking through his nose, and officiating as
waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.</p>

<p>“Bister Sikes!” exclaimed Barney, with
real or counterfeit joy; “cub id, sir; cub id.”</p>

<p>“Here! you get on first,” said Sikes, putting
Oliver in front of him. “Quicker! or I shall
tread upon your heels.”</p>

<p>Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes
pushed Oliver before him, and they entered a
low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three
broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch, on
which, with his legs much higher than his head,
a man was reposing at full length, smoking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
long clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut
snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons,
an orange neckerchief, a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern
waistcoat, and drab breeches. Mr.
Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity
of hair, either upon his head or face, but
what he had was of a reddish dye, and tortured
into long corkscrew curls, through which he
occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented
with large common rings. He was a
trifle above the middle size, and apparently
rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance
by no means detracted from his own admiration
of his top-boots, which he contemplated
in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Bill, my boy!” said this figure, turning his
head towards the door, “I’m glad to see you.
I was almost afraid you’d given it up, in which
case I should have made a personal wentur.
Hallo!”</p>

<p>Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great
surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture
and demanded who that was.</p>

<p>“The boy—only the boy!” replied Sikes,
drawing a chair towards the fire.</p>

<p>“Wud of Bister Fagid’s lads,” exclaimed
Barney, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Fagin’s, eh!” exclaimed Toby, looking at
Oliver. “Wot an inwalable boy that’ll make
for the old ladies’ pockets in chapels. His
mug is a fortun’ to him.”</p>

<p>“There—there’s enough of that,” interposed
Sikes, impatiently, and stooping over
his recumbent friend he whispered a few words
in his ear, at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely,
and honoured Oliver with a long stare
of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Sikes, as he resumed his seat,
“if you’ll give us something to eat and drink
while we’re waiting, you’ll put some heart in
us,—or in me, at all events. Sit down by the
fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you’ll have
to go out with us again to-night, though not
very far off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver looked at Sikes in mute and timid
wonder, and drawing a stool to the fire, sat
with his aching head upon his hands, scarcely
knowing where he was, or what was passing
around him.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Toby, as the young Jew placed
some fragments of food and a bottle upon the
table, “Success to the crack!” He rose to
honour the toast, and, carefully depositing his
empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table,
filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.
Mr. Sikes did the same.</p>

<p>“A drain for the boy,” said Toby, half filling
a wine-glass. “Down with it, innocence.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Oliver, looking piteously up
into the man’s face; “indeed, I——”</p>

<p>“Down with it!” echoed Toby. “Do you
think I don’t know what’s good for you? Tell
him to drink it, Bill.”</p>

<p>“He had better,” said Sikes, clapping his
hand upon his pocket. “Burn my body, if
he isn’t more trouble than a whole family of
Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Frightened by the menacing gestures of the
two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents
of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent
fit of coughing, which delighted Toby Crackit
and Barney, and even drew a smile from the
surly Mr. Sikes.</p>

<p>This done, and Sikes having satisfied his
appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small
crust of bread which they made him swallow),
the two men laid themselves down on chairs for
a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the
fire; and Barney, wrapped in a blanket,
stretched himself on the floor, close outside the
fender.</p>

<p>They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some
time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose
once or twice to throw coals upon the fire.
Oliver fell into a heavy doze, imagining himself
straying along through the gloomy lanes, or
wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing
some one or other of the scenes of
the past day, when he was roused by Toby
Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant the other two were on their
legs, and all were actively engaged in busy
preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped
their necks and chins in large dark
shawls, and drew on their great-coats, while
Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth
several articles, which he hastily crammed into
the pockets.</p>

<p>“Barkers for me, Barney,” said Toby
Crackit.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” replied Barney, producing
a pair of pistols. “You loaded them yourself.”</p>

<p>“All right!” replied Toby, stowing them
away. “The persuaders?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got ’em,” replied Sikes.</p>

<p>“Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies—nothing
forgotten?” inquired Toby, fastening a small
crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.</p>

<p>“All right,” rejoined his companion. “Bring
them bits of timber, Barney: that’s the time of
day.”</p>

<p>With these words he took a thick stick from
Barney’s hands, who, having delivered another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver’s
cape.</p>

<p>“Now then!” said Sikes, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>Oliver, who was completely stupified by the
unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink
which had been forced upon him, put his hand
mechanically into that which Sikes extended
for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Take his other hand, Toby,” said Sikes.
“Look out, Barney.”</p>

<p>The man went to the door, and returned to
announce that all was quiet. The two robbers
issued forth with Oliver between them; and
Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up
as before, and was soon asleep again.</p>

<p>It was now intensely dark. The fog was
much heavier than it had been in the early
part of the night, and the atmosphere was so
damp that, although no rain fell, Oliver’s hair
and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving
the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen
moisture that was floating about. They crossed
the bridge, and kept on towards the lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which he had seen before. They were at no
great distance off; and, as they walked pretty
briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.</p>

<p>“Slap through the town,” whispered Sikes;
“there’ll be nobody in the way to-night to see
us.”</p>

<p>Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through
the main street of the little town, which at that
late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light
shone at intervals from some bedroom-window,
and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally
broke the silence of the night; but there was
nobody abroad, and they had cleared the town
as the church bell struck two.</p>

<p>Quickening their pace, they turned up a road
upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter
of a mile, they stopped before a detached
house surrounded by a wall, to the top of which
Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath,
climbed in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“The boy next,” said Toby. “Hoist him
up: I’ll catch hold of him.”</p>

<p>Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes
had caught him under the arms, and in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the
grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly,
and they stole cautiously towards the
house.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time, Oliver, well nigh
mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking
and robbery, if not murder, were the objects
of the expedition. He clasped his hands
together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued
exclamation of horror. A mist came before
his eyes, the cold sweat stood upon his ashy
face, his limbs failed him, and he sunk upon his
knees.</p>

<p>“Get up!” murmured Sikes, trembling with
rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket;
“get up, or I’ll strew your brains upon the
grass.”</p>

<p>“Oh! for God’s sake let me go!” cried
Oliver; “let me run away and die in the fields.
I will never come near London; never, never!
Oh! pray have mercy upon me, and do not
make me steal. For the love of all the bright
angels that rest in heaven, have mercy upon me!”</p>

<p>The man to whom this appeal was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the
pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp,
placed his hand upon the boy’s mouth and
dragged him to the house.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried the man; “it wont answer
here. Say another word, and I’ll do your
business myself with a crack on the head that
makes no noise, and is quite as certain and
more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter
open. He’s game enough, now, I’ll engage.
I’ve seen older hands of his age took the same
way for a minute or two on a cold night.”</p>

<p>Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon
Fagin’s head for sending Oliver on such an
errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but
with little noise; after some delay, and some
assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he
had referred swung open on its hinges.</p>

<p>It was a little lattice window, about five feet
and a half above the ground, at the back of
the house, which belonged to a scullery, or small
brewing-place, at the end of the passage: the
aperture was so small that the inmates had probably
not thought it worth while to defend it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
more securely; but it was large enough to
admit a boy of Oliver’s size nevertheless. A
very brief exercise of Mr. Sikes’s art sufficed to
overcome the fastening of the lattice, and it
soon stood wide open also.</p>

<p>“Now listen, you young limb,” whispered
Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket,
and throwing the glare full on Oliver’s face;
“I’m a going to put you through there. Take
this light, go softly up the steps straight afore
you, and along the little hall to the street-door:
unfasten it, and let us in.”</p>

<p>“There’s a bolt at the top you wont be able
to reach,” interposed Toby. “Stand upon one
of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill,
with a jolly large blue unicorn and a gold pitchfork
on ’em, which is the old lady’s arms.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, can’t you?” replied Sikes, with
a threatening look. “The room-door is open,
is it?”</p>

<p>“Wide,” replied Toby, after peeping in to
satisfy himself. “The game of that is that they
always leave it open with a catch, so that the
dog, who’s got a bed in here, may walk up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha!
ha! Barney ’ticed him away to-night, so neat.”</p>

<p>Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely
audible whisper, and laughed without noise,
Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent,
and to get to work. Toby complied by first
producing his lantern, and placing it on the
ground; and then planting himself firmly with
his head against the wall beneath the window,
and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a
step of his back. This was no sooner done
than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver
gently through the window with his feet first;
and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted
him safely on the floor inside.</p>

<p>“Take this lantern,” said Sikes, looking
into the room. “You see the stairs afore
you?”</p>

<p>Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out,
“Yes;” and Sikes, pointing to the street-door
with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to
take notice that he was within shot all the way,
and that if he faltered he would fall dead that
instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s done in a minute,” said Sikes, in the
same low whisper. “Directly I leave go of
you, do your work. Hark!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” whispered the other man.</p>

<p>They listened intently.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Sikes, releasing his hold of
Oliver. “Now!”</p>

<p>In the short time he had had to collect his
senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether
he died in the attempt or not, he would
make one effort to dart up stairs from the hall
and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he
advanced at once, but stealthily.</p>

<p>“Come back!” suddenly cried Sikes aloud.
“Back! back!”</p>

<p>Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead
stillness of the place, and a loud cry which followed
it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew
not whether to advance or fly.</p>

<p>The cry was repeated—a light appeared—a
vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the
top of the stairs swam before his eyes—a flash—a
loud noise—a smoke—a crash somewhere, but
where he knew not,—and he staggered back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he
was up again, and had him by the collar before
the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own
pistol after the men who were already retreating,
and dragged the boy up.</p>

<p>“Clasp your arm tighter,” said Sikes, as he
drew him through the window. “Give me a
shawl here. They’ve hit him. Quick! Damnation,
how the boy bleeds!”</p>

<p>Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled
with the noise of fire-arms and the shouts of
men, and the sensation of being carried over
uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then the
noises grew confused in the distance, and a cold
deadly feeling crept over the boy’s heart, and
he saw or heard no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION
BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHEWS
THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME
POINTS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was bitter cold. The snow lay
upon the ground frozen into a hard thick crust,
so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways
and corners were affected by the sharp
wind that howled abroad, which, as if expending
increased fury on such prey as it found,
caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it
into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.
Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night
for the well-housed and fed to draw round the
bright fire and thank God they were at home,
and for the homeless starving wretch to lay
him down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
close their eyes in our bare streets at such
times, who, let their crimes have been what
they may, can hardly open them in a more
bitter world.</p>

<p>Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs
when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse,
to which our readers have been already
introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist,
sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her
own little room, and glanced with no small degree
of complacency at a small round table, on
which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished
with all necessary materials for the most
grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact,
Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a
cup of tea: and as she glanced from the table
to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible
kettles was singing a small song in a small
voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,—so
much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney
smiled.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the matron, leaning her elbow
on the table, and looking reflectively at the
fire, “I’m sure we have all on us a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to be grateful for—a great deal, if we did but
know it. Ah!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if
deploring the mental blindness of those paupers
who did not know it, and thrusting a silver
spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses
of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded
to make the tea.</p>

<p>How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity
of our frail minds! The black teapot,
being very small and easily filled, ran over
while Mrs. Corney was moralizing, and the
water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney’s hand.</p>

<p>“Drat the pot!” said the worthy matron,
setting it down very hastily on the hob; “a
little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of
cups! What use is it of to any body?—except,”
said Mrs. Corney, pausing,—“except
to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh
dear!”</p>

<p>With these words the matron dropped into
her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on
the table, thought of her solitary fate. The
small teapot and the single cup had awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney
(who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty
years), and she was overpowered.</p>

<p>“I shall never get another!” said Mrs.
Corney, pettishly; “I shall never get another—like
him.”</p>

<p>Whether this remark bore reference to the
husband or the teapot is uncertain. It might
have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked
at it as she spoke, and took it up afterwards.
She had just tasted her first cup, when she was
disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.</p>

<p>“Oh, come in with you!” said Mrs. Corney,
sharply. “Some of the old women dying, I
suppose;—they always die when I’m at meals.
Don’t stand there, letting the cold air in, don’t.
What’s amiss now, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, ma’am, nothing,” replied a man’s
voice.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, in a
much sweeter tone, “is that Mr. Bumble?”</p>

<p>“At your service, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble,
who had been stopping outside to rub his
shoes clean, and shake the snow off his coat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and who now made his appearance, bearing the
cocked-hat in one hand and a bundle in the
other. “Shall I shut the door, ma’am?”</p>

<p>The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest
there should be any impropriety in holding an
interview with Mr. Bumble with closed doors.
Mr. Bumble, taking advantage of the hesitation,
and being very cold himself, shut it without
farther permission.</p>

<p>“Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,” said the
matron.</p>

<p>“Hard, indeed, ma’am,” replied the beadle.
“Anti-porochial weather this, ma’am. We have
given away, Mrs. Corney,—we have given away
a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a
cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon;
and yet them paupers are not contented.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. When would they be, Mr.
Bumble?” said the matron, sipping her tea.</p>

<p>“When, indeed, ma’am!” rejoined Mr. Bumble.
“Why, here’s one man that, in consideration
of his wife and large family, has a quartern
loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight.
Is he grateful, ma’am,—is he grateful? Not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
copper farthing’s worth of it! What does he
do, ma’am, but ask for a few coals, if it’s only
a pocket-handkerchief full, he says! Coals!—what
would he do with coals?—Toast his
cheese with ’em, and then come back for more.
That’s the way with these people, ma’am;—give
’em a apron full of coals to-day, and they’ll
came back for another the day after to-morrow,
as brazen as alabaster.”</p>

<p>The matron expressed her entire concurrence
in this intelligible simile, and the beadle went
on.</p>

<p>“I never,” said Mr. Bumble, “see anything
like the pitch it’s got to. The day afore yesterday,
a man—you have been a married woman,
ma’am, and I may mention it to you—a
man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here
Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our
overseer’s door when he has got company
coming to dinner, and says, he must be relieved,
Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn’t go away,
and shocked the company very much, our overseer
sent him out a pound of potatoes and half
a pint of oatmeal. ‘My God!’ says the ungrateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
villain, ‘what’s the use of <i>this</i> to me?
You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles
‘Very good,’ says our overseer, taking
’em away again, ‘you wont get anything else
here.’—‘Then I’ll die in the streets!’ says the
vagrant.—‘Oh no, you wont,’ says our overseer.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!—that was very good!—so like
Mr. Grannet, wasn’t it?” interposed the matron.
“Well, Mr. Bumble?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” rejoined the beadle, “he
went away and <i>did</i> die in the streets. There’s
a obstinate pauper for you!”</p>

<p>“It beats anything I could have believed,”
observed the matron, emphatically. “But don’t
you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing
any way, Mr. Bumble? You’re a gentleman of
experience, and ought to know. Come.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Corney,” said the beadle, smiling as
men smile who are conscious of superior information,
“out-of-door relief, properly managed,—properly
managed, ma’am,—is the
porochial safeguard. The great principle of
out-of-door relief is to give the paupers exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
what they don’t want, and then they get
tired of coming.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Corney. “Well,
that is a good one, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Betwixt you and me, ma’am,” returned
Mr. Bumble, “that’s the great principle;
and that’s the reason why, if you look at any
cases that get into them owdacious newspapers,
you’ll always observe that sick families have
been relieved with slices of cheese. That’s the
rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country.—But,
however,” said the beadle, stooping to
unpack his bundle, “these are official secrets,
ma’am; not to be spoken of except, as I may
say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.
This is the port wine, ma’am, that the
board ordered for the infirmary,—real, fresh,
genuine port wine, only out of the cask this
afternoon,—clear as a bell, and no sediment.”</p>

<p>Having held the first bottle up to the light,
and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr.
Bumble placed them both on the top of a chest
of drawers, folded the handkerchief in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they had been wrapped, put it carefully in his
pocket, and took up his hat as if to go.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,”
said the matron.</p>

<p>“It blows, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble,
turning up his coat-collar, “enough to cut one’s
ears off.”</p>

<p>The matron looked from the little kettle to
the beadle who was moving towards the door,
and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding
her good night, bashfully inquired whether—whether
he wouldn’t take a cup of tea?</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his
collar again, laid his hat and stick upon a chair,
and drew another chair up to the table. As he
slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.
She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. Mr.
Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and
saucer from the closet. As she sat down, her
eyes once again encountered those of the gallant
beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the
task of making his tea. Again Mr. Bumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
coughed,—louder this time than he had coughed
yet.</p>

<p>“Sweet? Mr. Bumble,” inquired the matron,
taking up the sugar-basin.</p>

<p>“Very sweet, indeed, ma’am,” replied Mr.
Bumble. He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as
he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender,
Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment.</p>

<p>The tea was made, and handed in silence.
Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over
his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying
the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and
drink; varying these amusements occasionally
by fetching a deep sigh, which, however, had no
injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the
contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations
in the tea and toast department.</p>

<p>“You have a cat, ma’am, I see,” said Mr.
Bumble, glancing at one, who, in the centre of
her family, was basking before the fire; “and
kittens too, I declare!”</p>

<p>“I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you
can’t think,” replied the matron. “They’re <i>so</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
happy, <i>so</i> frolicsome, and <i>so</i> cheerful, that they
are quite companions for me.”</p>

<p>“Very nice animals, ma’am,” replied Mr.
Bumble, approvingly; “so very domestic.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” rejoined the matron, with enthusiasm;
“so fond of their home too, that it’s
quite a pleasure, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Corney, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble,
slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon,
“I mean to say this, ma’am, that any cat or
kitten that could live with you, ma’am, and <i>not</i>
be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bumble!” remonstrated Mrs.
Corney.</p>

<p>“It’s no use disguising facts, ma’am,” said
Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon
with a kind of amorous dignity that made him
doubly impressive; “I would drown it myself
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a cruel man,” said the matron
vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the
beadle’s cup, “and a very hard-hearted man
besides.”</p>

<p>“Hard-hearted, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“hard!” Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without
another word, squeezed Mrs. Corney’s little
finger as she took it, and inflicting two open-handed
slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a
mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little
morsel farther from the fire.</p>

<p>It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney
and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each
other, with no great space between them, and
fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble,
in receding from the fire, and still keeping
at the table, increased the distance between
himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding
some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed
to admire, and to consider an act of great
heroism on Mr. Bumble’s part, he being in
some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity,
to give utterance to certain soft nothings,
which, however well they may become the lips
of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably
beneath the dignity of judges of the
land, members of parliament, ministers of state,
lord-mayors, and other great public functionaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but more particularly beneath the stateliness
and gravity of a beadle, who (as is well
known) should be the sternest and most inflexible
among them all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i068.jpg" width="428" height="500" alt="couple sitting at table by fire while cats play on the floor" />
<div class="caption"><i>Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Corney taking tea.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Whatever were Mr. Bumble’s intentions,
however,—and no doubt they were of the best,—whatever
they were, it unfortunately, happened,
as has been twice before remarked, that
the table was a round one; consequently, Mr.
Bumble, moving his chair by little and little,
soon began to diminish the distance between
himself and the matron, and, continuing to
travel round the outer edge of the circle,
brought his chair in time close to that in which
the matron was seated. Indeed, the two chairs
touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble
stopped.</p>

<p>Now, if the matron had moved her chair to
the right, she would have been scorched by the
fire, and if to the left, she must have fallen into
Mr. Bumble’s arms; so (being a discreet
matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences
at a glance) she remained where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of
tea.</p>

<p>“Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?” said Mr.
Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into
the matron’s face; “are <i>you</i> hard-hearted, Mrs.
Corney?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, “what a
very curious question from a single man. What
can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?”</p>

<p>The beadle drank his tea to the last drop,
finished a piece of toast, whisked the crumbs
off his knees, wiped his lips, and deliberately
kissed the matron.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bumble,” cried that discreet lady in a
whisper, for the fright was so great that she had
quite lost her voice, “Mr. Bumble, I shall
scream!” Mr. Bumble made no reply, but in
a slow and dignified manner put his arm round
the matron’s waist.</p>

<p>As the lady had stated her intention of
screaming, of course she would have screamed
at this additional boldness, but that the exertion
was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at the door, which was no sooner heard than
Mr. Bumble darted with much agility to the
wine-bottles, and began dusting them with
great violence, while the matron sharply demanded
who was there. It is worthy of remark,
as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of
a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of
extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered
all its official asperity.</p>

<p>“If you please, mistress,” said a withered
old female pauper, hideously ugly, putting her
head in at the door, “Old Sally is a-going
fast.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s that to me?” angrily demanded
the matron. “I can’t keep her alive,
can I?”</p>

<p>“No, no, mistress,” replied the old woman;
“nobody can; she’s far beyond the
reach of help. I’ve seen a many people die,
little babes and great strong men, and I know
when death’s a-coming well enough. But
she’s troubled in her mind; and when the
fits are not on her,—and that’s not often, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she is dying very hard,—she says she has got
something to tell which you must hear. She’ll
never die quiet till you come, mistress.”</p>

<p>At this intelligence the worthy Mrs. Corney
muttered a variety of invectives against old
women who couldn’t even die without purposely
annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in
a thick shawl which she hastily caught up,
briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stop till she
came back, lest anything particular should
occur, and bidding the messenger walk fast, and
not be all night hobbling up the stairs, followed
her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding
all the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble’s conduct on being left to himself
was rather inexplicable. He opened the
closet, counted the tea-spoons, weighed the
sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot
to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal;
and, having satisfied his curiosity upon these
points, put on his cocked-hat corner-wise, and
danced with much gravity four distinct times
round the table. Having gone through this
very extraordinary performance, he took off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cocked-hat again, and, spreading himself before
the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be
mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory
of the furniture.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>TREATS OF A VERY POOR SUBJECT, BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND
MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was no unfit messenger of death that had
disturbed the quiet of the matron’s room. Her
body was bent by age, her limbs trembled with
palsy, and her face, distorted into a mumbling
leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of
some wild pencil than the work of Nature’s
hand.</p>

<p>Alas! how few of Nature’s faces there are to
gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and
sorrows, and hungerings of the world change
them as they change hearts, and it is only when
those passions sleep, and have lost their hold
for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and
leave heaven’s surface clear. It is a common
thing for the countenances of the dead, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the
long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy,
and settle into the very look of early life; so
calm, so peaceful do they grow again, that those
who knew them in their happy childhood kneel
by the coffin’s side in awe, and see the angel
even upon earth.</p>

<p>The old crone tottered along the passages and
up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers
to the chidings of her companion; and being
at length compelled to pause for breath, gave
the light into her hand, and remained behind to
follow as she might, while the more nimble
superior made her way to the room where the
sick woman lay.</p>

<p>It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light
burning at the farther end. There was another
old woman watching by the bed, and the parish
apothecary’s apprentice was standing by the
fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.</p>

<p>“Cold night, Mrs. Corney,” said this young
gentleman, as the matron entered.</p>

<p>“Very cold indeed, sir,” replied the mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“You should get better coals out of your
contractors,” said the apothecary’s deputy,
breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
rusty poker; “these are not at all the sort of
thing for a cold night.”</p>

<p>“They’re the board’s choosing, sir,” returned
the matron. “The least they could
do would be to keep us pretty warm, for our
places are hard enough.”</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by a
moan from the sick woman.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the young man, turning his face
towards the bed, as if he had previously quite
forgotten the patient, “it’s all U. P. there, Mrs.
Corney.”</p>

<p>“It is, is it, sir?” asked the matron.</p>

<p>“If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be
surprised,” said the apothecary’s apprentice,
intent upon the toothpick’s point. “It’s a
break-up of the system altogether. Is she
dozing, old lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain,
and nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps she’ll go off in that way, if
you don’t make a row,” said the young man.
“Put the light on the floor,—she wont see it
there.”</p>

<p>The attendant did as she was bidden, shaking
her head meanwhile to intimate that the woman
would not die so easily; and having done so,
resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse,
who had by this time returned. The mistress,
with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself
in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>The apothecary’s apprentice, having completed
the manufacture of the toothpick, planted
himself in front of the fire and made good use
of it for ten minutes or so, when, apparently
growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy
of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.</p>

<p>When they had sat in silence for some time
the two old women rose from the bed, and
crouching over the fire, held out their withered
hands to catch the heat. The flame threw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made
their ugliness appear perfectly terrible, as in
this position they began to converse in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I
was gone?” inquired the messenger.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” replied the other. “She
plucked and tore at her arms for a little time;
but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off.
She hasn’t much strength in her, so I easily
kept her quiet. I ain’t so weak for an old
woman, although I am on parish allowance;—no,
no!”</p>

<p>“Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said
she was to have?” demanded the first.</p>

<p>“I tried to get it down,” rejoined the other;
“but her teeth were tight set, and she clenched
the mug so hard that it was as much as I could
do to get it back again. So <i>I</i> drank it, and it
did me good.”</p>

<p>Looking cautiously round to ascertain that
they were not overheard, the two hags cowered
nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mind the time,” said the first speaker,
“when she would have done the same, and
made rare fun of it afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that she would,” rejoined the other;
“she had a merry heart. A many many beautiful
corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as
wax-work. My old eyes have seen them—ay,
and these old hands touched them too; for I
have helped her scores of times.”</p>

<p>Stretching forth her trembling fingers as
she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly
before her face, and fumbling in her
pocket brought out an old time-discoloured tin
snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains
into the outstretched palm of her companion,
and a few more into her own. While they were
thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently
watching until the dying woman
should awaken from her stupor, joined them by
the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to
wait.</p>

<p>“Not long, mistress,” replied the second
woman, looking up into her face. “We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
none of us long to wait for Death. Patience,
patience! he’ll be here soon enough for us
all.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!” said
the matron, sternly. “You, Martha, tell me;
has she been in this way before?”</p>

<p>“Often,” answered the first woman.</p>

<p>“But will never be again,” added the second
one; “that is, she’ll never wake again but once—and
mind, mistress, that wont be for long.”</p>

<p>“Long or short,” said the matron, snappishly,
“she wont find me here when she does,
and take care, both of you, how you worry me
again for nothing. It’s no part of my duty to
see all the old women in the house die, and I
wont—that’s more. Mind that, you impudent
old harridans. If you make a fool of me again,
I’ll soon cure you, I warrant you!”</p>

<p>She was bouncing away, when a cry from the
two women, who had turned towards the bed,
caused her to look round. The sick woman
had raised herself upright, and was stretching
her arms towards them.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” she cried, in a hollow voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” said one of the women,
stooping over her—“lie down, lie down!”</p>

<p>“I’ll never lie down again alive!” said the
woman, struggling. “I <i>will</i> tell her! Come
here—nearer. Let me whisper in your ear.”</p>

<p>She clutched the matron by the arm, and
forcing her into a chair by the bedside was about
to speak, when looking round, she caught sight
of the two old women bending forward in the
attitude of eager listeners.</p>

<p>“Turn them away,” said the woman, drowsily;
“make haste—make haste!”</p>

<p>The two old crones, chiming in together,
began pouring out many piteous lamentations
that the poor dear was too far gone to know her
best friends, and uttering sundry protestations
that they would never leave her, when the
superior pushed them from the room, closed
the door, and returned to the bedside. On
being excluded, the old ladies changed their
tone, and cried through the keyhole that old
Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely,
since, in addition to a moderate dose of
opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin
and water which had been privily administered
in the openness of their hearts by the worthy
old ladies themselves.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me,” said the dying woman,
aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one
latent spark of energy. “In this very room—in
this very bed—I once nursed a pretty young
creetur’, that was brought into the house with
her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all
soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to
a boy, and died. Let me think—what was the
year again?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the year,” said the impatient
auditor; “what about her?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” murmured the sick woman, relapsing
into her former drowsy state, “what about her?—what
about—I know!” she cried, jumping
fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting
from her head—“I robbed her, so I did!
She wasn’t cold—I tell you she wasn’t cold,
when I stole it!”</p>

<p>“Stole what, for God’s sake?” cried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
matron, with a gesture as if she would call for
help.</p>

<p>“<i>It!</i>” replied the woman, laying her hand
over the other’s mouth—“the only thing she
had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm,
and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and
had it in her bosom. It was gold, I tell you!—rich
gold, that might have saved her life!”</p>

<p>“Gold!” echoed the matron, bending eagerly
over the woman as she fell back. “Go on, go
on—yes—what of it? Who was the mother?—when
was it?”</p>

<p>“She charged me to keep it safe,” replied the
woman, with a groan, “and trusted me as the
only woman about her. I stole it in my heart
when she first shewed it me hanging round her
neck; and the child’s death, perhaps, is on me
besides! They would have treated him better
if they had known it all!”</p>

<p>“Known what?” asked the other. “Speak!”</p>

<p>“The boy grew so like his mother,” said the
woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question,
“that I could never forget it when I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
his face. Poor girl! poor girl!—she was so
young, too!—such a gentle lamb!—Wait;
there’s more to tell. I have not told you all,
have I?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied the matron, inclining her
head to catch the words as they came more
faintly from the dying woman.—“Be quick, or
it may be too late!”</p>

<p>“The mother,” said the woman, making a
more violent effort than before—“the mother,
when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered
in my ear that if her baby was born alive,
and thrived, the day might come when it would
not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young
mother named. ‘And oh, my God!’ she said,
folding her thin hands together, ‘whether it be
boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this
troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely, desolate
child, abandoned to its mercy!’”</p>

<p>“The boy’s name?” demanded the matron.</p>

<p>“They <i>called</i> him Oliver,” replied the woman,
feebly. “The gold I stole was——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—what?” cried the other.</p>

<p>She was bending eagerly over the woman to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hear her reply, but drew back instinctively as
she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a
sitting posture, and, clutching the coverlid with
both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in
her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Stone dead!” said one of the old women,
hurrying in as soon as the door was opened.</p>

<p>“And nothing to tell, after all,” rejoined the
matron, walking carelessly away.</p>

<p>The two crones were, to all appearance, too
busily occupied in the preparations for their
dreadful duties to make any reply, and were left
alone hovering about the body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND
COMPANY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> these things were passing in the
country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old
den—the same from which Oliver had been removed
by the girl—brooding over a dull smoky
fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee,
with which he had apparently been endeavouring
to rouse it into more cheerful action; but
he had fallen into deep thought, and with his
arms folded upon them, and his chin resting on
his thumbs, fixed his eyes abstractedly on the
rusty bars.</p>

<p>At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger,
Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling, all
intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking
dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.
The countenance of the first-named gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great
additional interest from his close observance of
the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling’s
hand, upon which, from time to time, as
occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest
glances, wisely regulating his own play by
the result of his observations upon his neighbour’s
cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger
wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom
within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe
between his teeth, which he only removed for
a brief space when he deemed it necessary to
apply for refreshment to a quart-pot upon the
table, which stood ready filled with gin and
water for the accommodation of the company.</p>

<p>Master Bates was also attentive to the play;
but being of a more excitable nature than his
accomplished friend, it was observable that he
more frequently applied himself to the gin and
water, and moreover indulged in many jests
and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a
scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming
upon their close attachment, more than once
took occasion to reason gravely with his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
upon these improprieties: all of which
remonstrances Master Bates took in extremely
good part, merely requesting his friend to be
“blowed,” or to insert his head in a sack, or replying
with some other neatly-turned witticism
of a similar kind, the happy application of which
excited considerable admiration in the mind of
Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter
gentleman and his partner invariably lost, and
that the circumstance, so far from angering
Master Bates, appeared to afford him the
highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed
most uproariously at the end of every deal, and
protested that he had never seen such a jolly
game in all his born days.</p>

<p>“That’s two doubles and the rub,” said Mr.
Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half-a-crown
from his waistcoat-pocket “I never
see such a feller as you, Jack; you win every
thing. Even when we’ve good cards, Charley
and I can’t make nothing of ’em.”</p>

<p>Either the matter or manner of this remark,
which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley
Bates so much, that his consequent shout of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and
induced him to inquire what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Matter, Fagin!” cried Charley. “I wish
you had watched a play. Tommy Chitling
hasn’t won the point, and I went partners with
him against the Artful and dum.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay!” said the Jew, with a grin, which
sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss
to understand the reason. “Try ’em again,
Tom; try ’em again.”</p>

<p>“No more of it for me, thankee, Fagin,” replied
Mr. Chitling; “I’ve had enough. That
’ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there’s
no standing again’ him.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! my dear,” replied the Jew, “you
must get up very early in the morning to win
against the Dodger.”</p>

<p>“Morning!” said Charley Bates; “you must
put your boots on overnight, and have a telescope
at each eye, and a opera-glass between
your shoulders, if you want to come over him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments
with much philosophy, and offered to
cut any gentleman in company for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
picture-card, at a shilling a time. Nobody accepting
the challenge, and his pipe being by
this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse
himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate
on the table with the piece of chalk which had
served him in lieu of counters; whistling meantime
with peculiar shrillness.</p>

<p>“How precious dull you are, Tommy!” said
the Dodger, stopping short when there had been
a long silence, and addressing Mr. Chitling.
“What do you think he’s thinking of, Fagin?”</p>

<p>“How should I know, my dear?” replied the
Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows.
“About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement
in the country that he’s just left, eh?—Ha!
ha! Is that it, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied the Dodger, stopping
the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling
was about to reply. “What do <i>you</i> say,
Charley?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> should say,” replied Master Bates, with a
grin, “that he was uncommon sweet upon
Betsy. See how he’s a-blushing! Oh, my eye!
here’s a merry-go-rounder!—Tommy Chitling’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in love!—Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a
spree!”</p>

<p>Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of
Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender
passion, Master Bates threw himself back in
his chair with such violence that he lost his
balance, and pitched over upon the floor, where
(the accident abating nothing of his merriment)
he lay at full length till his laugh was over,
when he resumed his former position and began
another.</p>

<p>“Never mind him, my dear,” said the Jew,
winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master
Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the
bellows. “Betsy’s a fine girl. Stick up to
her, Tom: stick up to her.”</p>

<p>“What I mean to say, Fagin,” replied Mr.
Chitling, very red in the face, “is, that that
isn’t anything to anybody here.”</p>

<p>“No more it is,” replied the Jew “Charley
will talk. Don’t mind him, my dear; don’t
mind him. Betsy’s a fine girl. Do as she
bids you, Tom, and you’ll make your fortune.”</p>

<p>“So I <i>do</i> do as she bids me,” replied Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Chitling; “I shouldn’t have been milled if it
hadn’t been for her advice. But it turned out
a good job for you, didn’t it, Fagin? And
what’s six weeks of it? It must come some
time or another; and why not in the winter
time when you don’t want to go out a-walking
so much; eh, Fagin?”</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure, my dear,” replied the
Jew.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t mind it again, Tom, would
you,” asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley
and the Jew, “if Bet was all right?”</p>

<p>“I mean to say that I shouldn’t,” replied
Tom, angrily; “there, now! Ah! Who’ll say
as much as that, I should like to know; eh,
Fagin?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, my dear,” replied the Jew;
“not a soul, Tom. I don’t know one of ’em
that would do it besides you; not one of ’em,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“I might have got clear off if I’d split upon
her; mighn’t I, Fagin?” angrily pursued the
poor half-witted dupe. “A word from me
would have done it; wouldn’t it, Fagin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“To be sure it would, my dear,” replied the
Jew.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t blab it, did I, Fagin?” demanded
Tom, pouring question upon question
with great volubility.</p>

<p>“No, no, to be sure,” replied the Jew; “you
were too stout-hearted for that,—a deal too
stout, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was,” rejoined Tom, looking
round; “and if I was, what’s to laugh at in
that; eh, Fagin?”</p>

<p>The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was
considerably roused, hastened to assure him
that nobody was laughing, and, to prove the
gravity of the company, appealed to Master
Bates, the principal offender; but unfortunately
Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he
was never more serious in his life, was unable
to prevent the escape of such a violent roar
that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary
ceremonies rushed across the room,
and aimed a blow at the offender, who, being
skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it,
and chose his time so well that it lighted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the chest of the merry old gentleman, and
caused him to stagger to the wall, where he
stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling
looked on in intense dismay.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried the Dodger at this moment,
“I heard the tinkler.” Catching up the light,
he crept softly up stairs.</p>

<p>The bell rang again with some impatience
while the party were in darkness. After a
short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered
Fagin mysteriously.</p>

<p>“What!” cried the Jew, “alone?”</p>

<p>The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and,
shading the flame of the candle with his hand,
gave Charley Bates a private intimation in
dumb show that he had better not be funny
just then. Having performed this friendly
office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew’s face and
awaited his directions.</p>

<p>The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated
for some seconds; his face working with
agitation the while, as if he dreaded something,
and feared to know the worst. At length he
raised his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is he?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and
made a gesture as if to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Jew, answering the mute
inquiry; “bring him down. Hush!—Quiet,
Charley!—gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!”</p>

<p>This brief direction to Charley Bates and his
recent antagonist to retire, was softly and immediately
obeyed. There was no sound of
their whereabout when the Dodger descended
the stairs bearing the light in his hand, and
followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock,
who, after casting a hurried glance round the
room, pulled off a large wrapper which had
concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed—all
haggard, unwashed, and unshaven,
the features of flash Toby Crackit.</p>

<p>“How are you, Fagey?” said the worthy,
nodding to the Jew. “Pop that shawl away in
my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where
to find it when I cut; that’s the time of day!
You’ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old
file now.”</p>

<p>With these words he pulled up the smock-frock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and, winding it round his middle, drew a
chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the
hob.</p>

<p>“See there, Fagey,” he said, pointing disconsolately
to his top-boots; “not a drop of
Day and Martin since you know when; not a
bubble of blacking, by ——! but don’t look at
me in that way, man. All in good time; I
can’t talk about business till I’ve eat and
drank, so produce the sustainance, and let’s
have a quiet fill-out for the first time these
three days!”</p>

<p>The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place
what eatables there were upon the table; and,
seating himself opposite the housebreaker,
waited his leisure.</p>

<p>To judge from appearances, Toby was by no
means in a hurry to open the conversation.
At first the Jew contented himself with patiently
watching his countenance, as if to gain
from its expression some clue to the intelligence
he brought; but in vain. He looked
tired and worn, but there was the same complacent
repose upon his features that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
always wore, and through dirt, and beard, and
whisker, there still shone unimpaired the self-satisfied
smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then
the Jew in an agony of impatience watched
every morsel he put into his mouth, pacing up
and down the room meanwhile in irrepressible
excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued
to eat with the utmost outward indifference
until he could eat no more; and then,
ordering the Dodger out, closed the door, mixed
a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself
for talking.</p>

<p>“First and foremost, Fagey,” said Toby.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” interposed the Jew, drawing
up his chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits
and water, and to declare that the gin was
excellent; and then, placing his feet against the
low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to
about the level of his eye, quietly resumed.</p>

<p>“First and foremost, Fagey,” said the housebreaker,
“how’s Bill?”</p>

<p>“What!” screamed the Jew, starting from
his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, you don’t mean to say——” began
Toby, turning pale.</p>

<p>“Mean!” cried the Jew, stamping furiously
on the ground. “Where are they?—Sikes and
the boy—where are they?—where have they
been?—where are they hiding?—why have they
not been here?”</p>

<p>“The crack failed,” said Toby, faintly.</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper
from his pocket, and pointing to it.
“What more?”</p>

<p>“They fired and hit the boy. We cut over
the fields at the back with him between us—straight
as the crow flies—through hedge and
ditch. They gave chase. D—me! the whole
country was awake, and the dogs upon us.”</p>

<p>“The boy!” gasped the Jew.</p>

<p>“Bill had him on his back, and scudded like
the wind. We stopped to take him again
between us; his head hung down, and he was
cold. They were close upon our heels: every
man for himself, and each from the gallows.
We parted company, and left the youngster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that’s all I
know of him.”</p>

<p>The Jew stopped to hear no more; but
uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in
his hair, rushed from the room and from the
house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE
SCENE, AND MANY THINGS INSEPARABLE FROM THIS
HISTORY ARE DONE AND PERFORMED.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old man had gained the street corner
before he began to recover the effect of Toby
Crackit’s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing
of his unusual speed, but was still pressing onward
in the same wild and disordered manner,
when the sudden dashing past of a carriage, and
a boisterous cry from the foot-passengers, who
saw his danger, drove him back upon the pavement.
Avoiding as much as possible all the
main streets, and skulking only through the
byways and alleys, he at length emerged on
Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than
before; nor did he linger until he had again
turned into a court, when, as if conscious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he was now in his proper element, he fell into
his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe
more freely.</p>

<p>Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and
Holborn Hill meet, there opens, upon the right
hand as you come out of the city, a narrow and
dismal alley leading to Saffron Hill. In its
filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches
of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes
and patterns—for here reside the traders who
purchase them from pickpockets. Hundreds of
these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs
outside the windows, or flaunting from the
door-posts; and the shelves within are piled
with them. Confined as the limits of Field
Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its
beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. It is a
commercial colony of itself, the emporium of
petty larceny, visited at early morning and setting-in
of dusk by silent merchants, who traffic
in dark back-parlours, and go as strangely as
they come. Here the clothesman, the shoe-vamper,
and the rag-merchant, display their
goods as sign-boards to the petty thief; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy
fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust
and rot in the grimy cellars.</p>

<p>It was into this place that the Jew turned.
He was well known to the sallow denizens of
the lane, for such of them as were on the lookout
to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed
along. He replied to their salutations in the
same way, but bestowed no closer recognition
until he reached the further end of the alley,
when he stopped to address a salesman of small
stature, who had squeezed as much of his person
into a child’s chair as the chair would hold,
and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse
door.</p>

<p>“Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would
cure the hoptalmy!” said this respectable trader,
in acknowledgment of the Jew’s inquiry after
his health.</p>

<p>“The neighbourhood was a little too hot,
Lively,” said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows,
and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well! I’ve heerd that complaint of it once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
or twice before,” replied the trader; “but it
soon cools down again; don’t you find it so?”</p>

<p>Fagin nodded in the affirmative, and pointing
in the direction of Saffron Hill, inquired whether
any one was up yonder to-night.</p>

<p>“At the Cripples?” inquired the man.</p>

<p>The Jew nodded.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” pursued the merchant, reflecting.
“Yes; there’s some half-dozen of
’em gone in that I knows. I don’t think your
friend’s there.”</p>

<p>“Sikes is not, I suppose?” inquired the Jew,
with a disappointed countenance.</p>

<p>“<i>Non istwentus</i>, as the lawyers say,” replied
the little man, shaking his head, and looking
amazingly sly. “Have you got anything in
my line to-night?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to-night,” said the Jew, turning
away.</p>

<p>“Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?”
cried the little man, calling after him. “Stop!
I don’t mind if I have a drop there with
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand
to intimate that he preferred being alone; and,
moreover, as the little man could not very easily
disengage himself from the chair, the sign of the
Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage
of Mr. Lively’s presence. By the time he
had got upon his legs the Jew had disappeared;
so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on
tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him,
again forced himself into the little chair, and,
exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in
the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust
were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a
grave demeanour.</p>

<p>The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples,
which was the sign by which the establishment
was familiarly known to its patrons, was the
same public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his
dog have already figured. Merely making a
sign to a man in the bar, Fagin walked straight
up stairs, and opening the door of a room, and
softly insinuating himself into the chamber,
looked anxiously about, shading his eyes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his hand, as if in search of some particular
person.</p>

<p>The room was illuminated by two gas-lights,
the glare of which was prevented by the barred
shutters and closely-drawn curtains of faded red
from being visible outside. The ceiling was
blackened to prevent its colour being injured
by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was
so full of dense tobacco-smoke, that at first it
was scarcely possible to discern anything further.
By degrees, however, as some of it
cleared away through the open door, an assemblage
of heads, as confused as the noises that
greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the
eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the
spectator gradually became aware of the presence
of a numerous company, male and female,
crowded round a long table, at the upper end of
which sat a chairman with a hammer of office
in his hand, while a professional gentleman,
with a bluish nose and his face tied up for the
benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling
piano in a remote corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional
gentleman, running over the keys by way of
prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a
song; which having subsided, a young lady
proceeded to entertain the company with a
ballad in four verses, between each of which
the accompanyist played the melody all through
as loud as he could. When this was over, the
chairman gave a sentiment; after which, the
professional gentlemen on the chairman’s right
and left volunteered a duet, and sang it with
great applause.</p>

<p>It was curious to observe some faces which
stood out prominently from among the group.
There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of
the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy-built fellow,
who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled
his eyes hither and, thither, and, seeming to give
himself up to joviality, had an eye for every
thing that was done, and an ear for everything
that was said—and sharp ones, too. Near him
were the singers, receiving, with professional indifference,
the compliments of the company,
and applying themselves in turn to a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered
by their more boisterous admirers, whose countenances,
expressive of almost every vice in
almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the
attention by their very repulsiveness. Cunning,
ferocity, and drunkenness in all its stages,
were there in their strongest aspects; and
women—some with the last lingering tinge of
their early freshness almost fading as you
looked, and others with every mark and stamp
of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting
but one loathsome blank of profligacy and
crime—some mere girls, others but young
women, and none past the prime of life—formed
the darkest and saddest portion of this
dreary picture.</p>

<p>Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked
eagerly from face to face while these proceedings
were in progress, but, apparently, without
meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding,
at length, in catching the eye of the
man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to
him slightly, and left the room as quietly as he
had entered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?” inquired
the man, as he followed him out to the
landing. “Wont you join us? They’ll be
delighted, every one of ’em.”</p>

<p>The Jew shook his head impatiently, and
said in a whisper, “Is <i>he</i> here?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“And no news of Barney?” inquired Fagin.</p>

<p>“None,” replied the landlord of the Cripples;
for it was he. “He wont stir till it’s all safe.
Depend on it that they’re on the scent down
there, and that if he moved he’d blow upon the
thing at once. He’s all right enough, Barney
is, else I should have heard of him. I’ll pound
it that Barney’s managing properly. Let him
alone for that.”</p>

<p>“Will <i>he</i> be here to-night?” asked the Jew,
laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as
before.</p>

<p>“Monks, do you mean?” inquired the landlord,
hesitating.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said the Jew. “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Certain,” replied the man, drawing a gold
watch from his fob; “I expected him here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
before now. If you’ll wait ten minutes, he’ll
be——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the Jew, hastily, as though,
however desirous he might be to see the person
in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
absence. “Tell him I came here to see him,
and that he must come to me to-night; no, say
to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will
be time enough.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the man. “Nothing more?”</p>

<p>“Not a word now,” said the Jew, descending
the stairs.</p>

<p>“I say,” said the other, looking over the rails,
and speaking in a hoarse whisper; “what a
time this would be for a sell! I’ve got Phil
Barker here, so drunk that a boy might take
him.”</p>

<p>“Aha! But it’s not Phil Barker’s time,”
said the Jew, looking up. “Phil has something
more to do before we can afford to part with
him; so go back to the company, my dear, and
tell them to lead merry lives—<i>while they last</i>.
Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>The landlord reciprocated the old man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
laugh, and returned to his guests. The Jew
was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed
its former expression of anxiety and
thought. After a brief reflection, he called a
hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards
Bethnal Green. He dismissed him within some
quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes’s residence, and
performed the short remainder of the distance
on foot.</p>

<p>“Now,” muttered the Jew, as he knocked at
the door, “if there is any deep play here, I shall
have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.”</p>

<p>She was in her room, the woman said; so
Fagin crept softly up stairs, and entered it
without any previous ceremony. The girl was
alone, lying with her head upon the table, and
her hair straggling over it.</p>

<p>“She has been drinking,” thought the Jew,
coolly, “or perhaps she is only miserable.”</p>

<p>The old man turned to close the door as he
made this reflection, and the noise thus occasioned
roused the girl. She eyed his crafty
face narrowly, as she inquired whether there was
any news, and listened to his recital of Toby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Crackit’s story. When it was concluded, she
sunk into her former attitude, but spoke not a
word. She pushed the candle impatiently
away, and once or twice, as she feverishly
changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the
ground; but this was all.</p>

<p>During this silence, the Jew looked restlessly
about the room, as if to assure himself that
there were no appearances of Sikes having
covertly returned. Apparently satisfied with
his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and
made as many efforts to open a conversation;
but the girl heeded him no more than if he had
been made of stone. At length he made another
attempt, and, rubbing his hands together,
said, in his most conciliatory tone,</p>

<p>“And where should you think Bill was now,
my dear—eh?”</p>

<p>The girl moaned out some scarcely intelligible
reply, that she could not tell, and seemed,
from the half-smothered noise that escaped her,
to be crying.</p>

<p>“And the boy, too,” said the Jew, straining
his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. “Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
leetle child!—left in a ditch, Nance; only
think!”</p>

<p>“The child,” said the girl, suddenly looking
up, “is better where he is than among us:
and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he
lies dead in the ditch, and that his young bones
may rot there.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the Jew, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Ay, I do,” returned the girl, meeting his
gaze. “I shall be glad to have him away from
my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.
I can’t bear to have him about me. The sight
of him turns me against myself and all of
you.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Jew, scornfully. “You’re
drunk, girl.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” cried the girl, bitterly. “It’s no
fault of yours if I am not! you’d never have
me anything else if you had your will, except
now;—the humour doesn’t suit you, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“No!” rejoined the Jew, furiously. “It
does not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Change it, then!” responded the girl, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Change it!” exclaimed the Jew, exasperated
beyond all bounds by his companion’s
unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the
night, “I will change it! Listen to me, you
drab! listen to me, who with six words can
strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull’s
throat between my fingers now. If he comes
back, and leaves that boy behind him,—if he
gets off free, and, dead or alive, fails to restore
him to me, murder him yourself if you would
have him escape Jack Ketch, and do it the moment
he sets foot in this room, or, mind me, it
will be too late!”</p>

<p>“What is all this?” cried the girl, involuntarily.</p>


<p>“What is it?” pursued Fagin, mad with rage.
“This—When the boy’s worth hundreds of
pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw
me in the way of getting safely, through the
whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle
away the lives of,—and me bound, too, to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
born devil that only wants the will, and has got
the power to, to——”</p>

<p>Panting for breath, the old man stammered
for a word, and in that one instant checked the
torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole
demeanour. A moment before, his clenched
hands grasped the air, his eyes had dilated, and
his face grown livid with passion; but now he
shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together,
trembled with the apprehension of having himself
disclosed some hidden villany. After a
short silence, he ventured to look round at his
companion, and appeared somewhat reassured
on beholding her in the same listless attitude
from which he had first roused her.</p>

<p>“Nancy, dear!” croaked the Jew, in his usual
voice. “Did you mind me, dear?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry me, now, Fagin!” replied the
girl, raising her head languidly. “If Bill has
not done it this time, he will another. He has
done many a good job for you, and will do
many more when he can; and when he can’t,
he wont; so no more about that.”</p>

<p>“Regarding this boy, my dear?” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously
together.</p>

<p>“The boy must take his chance with the
rest,” interrupted Nancy, hastily; “and I say
again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm’s
way, and out of yours,—that is, if Bill comes
to no harm, and if Toby got clear off, he’s
pretty sure to, for he’s worth two of him any
time.”</p>

<p>“And about what I was saying, my dear?”
observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye
steadily upon her.</p>

<p>“You must say it all over again if it’s any
thing you want me to do,” rejoined Nancy:
“and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.
You put me up for a minute, but now
I’m stupid again.”</p>

<p>Fagin put several other questions, all with
the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl
had profited by his unguarded hints; but she
answered them so readily, and was withal so
utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that
his original impression of her being more
than a trifle in liquor was fully confirmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing
which was very common among the Jew’s
female pupils, and in which, in their tenderer
years, they were rather encouraged than checked.
Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale
perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment,
afforded strong confirmatory evidence of
the justice of the Jew’s supposition; and when,
after indulging in the temporary display of violence
above described, she subsided, first into
dulness, and afterwards into a compound of
feelings, under the influence of which she shed
tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance
to various exclamations of “Never say
die!” and divers calculations as to what might
be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or
gentleman were happy, Mr. Fagin, who had
had considerable experience of such matters in
his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she
was very far gone indeed.</p>

<p>Having eased his mind by this discovery, and
accomplished his twofold object of imparting to
the girl what he had that night heard, and
ascertaining with his own eyes that Sikes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face
homeward, leaving his young friend asleep with
her head upon the table.</p>

<p>It was within an hour of midnight, and the
weather being dark and piercing cold, he had
no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind
that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared
them of passengers as of dust and mud, for few
people were abroad, and they were to all appearance
hastening fast home. It blew from
the right quarter for the Jew, however, and
straight before it he went, trembling and shivering
as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his
way.</p>

<p>He had reached the corner of his own street,
and was already fumbling in his pocket for the
door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a
projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow,
and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.</p>

<p>“Fagin!” whispered a voice close to his
ear.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Jew, turning quickly round,
“is that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes!” interrupted the stranger, harshly.
“I have been lingering here these two hours.
Where the devil have you been?”</p>

<p>“On your business, my dear,” replied the
Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and
slackening his pace as he spoke. “On your
business all night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course!” said the stranger, with a
sneer. “Well; and what’s come of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing good,” said the Jew.</p>

<p>“Nothing bad, I hope?” said the stranger,
stopping short, and turning a startled look upon
his companion.</p>

<p>The Jew shook his head, and was about to
reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned
to the house before which they had
by this time arrived, and remarked, that he had
better say what he had got to say under cover,
for his blood was chilled with standing about so
long, and the wind blew through him.</p>

<p>Fagin looked as if he could have willingly
excused himself from taking home a visiter at
that unseasonable hour, and muttered something
about having no fire; but his companion repeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his request in a peremptory manner, he
unlocked the door, and requested him to close
it softly, while he got a light.</p>

<p>“It’s as dark as the grave,” said the man,
groping forward a few steps. “Make haste. I
hate this!”</p>

<p>“Shut the door,” whispered Fagin from the
end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed
with a loud noise.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t my doing,” said the other
man, feeling his way. “The wind blew it to,
or it shut of its own accord; one or the other.
Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my
brains out against something in this confounded
hole.”</p>

<p>Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs,
and, after a short absence, returned with a
lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby
Crackit was asleep in the back-room below,
and the boys in the front one. Beckoning the
other man to follow him, he led the way up
stairs.</p>

<p>“We can say the few words we’ve got to say
in here, my dear,” said the Jew, throwing open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a door on the first floor; “and as there are
holes in the shutters, and we never shew lights
to our neighbours, we’ll set the candle on the
stairs. There!”</p>

<p>With these words, the Jew, stooping down,
placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs,
exactly opposite the room door, and led the
way into the apartment, which was destitute of
all moveables save a broken arm-chair, and an
old couch or sofa without covering, which
stood behind the door. Upon this piece of
furniture the stranger flung himself with the air
of a weary man, and the Jew drawing up the
arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was
not quite dark, for the door was partially open,
and the candle outside threw a feeble reflection
on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>They conversed for some time in whispers;
although nothing of the conversation was distinguishable
beyond a few disjointed words here
and there; a listener might easily have perceived
that Fagin appeared to be defending
himself against some remarks of the stranger,
and that the latter was in a state of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
irritation. They might have been talking thus
for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks—by
which name the Jew had designated
the strange man several times in the course
of their colloquy—said, raising his voice a little,</p>

<p>“I tell you again it was badly planned. Why
not have kept him here among the rest, and
made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him
at once?”</p>

<p>“Only hear him!” exclaimed the Jew,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Why, do you mean to say you couldn’t
have done it if you had chosen?” demanded
Monks, sternly. “Haven’t you done it with
other boys scores of times? If you had had
patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn’t
you have got him convicted and sent safely out
of the kingdom, perhaps for life?”</p>

<p>“Whose turn would that have served, my
dear?” inquired the Jew, humbly.</p>

<p>“Mine,” replied Monks.</p>

<p>“But not mine,” said the Jew, submissively.
“He might have become of use to me. When
there are two parties to a bargain, it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
reasonable that the interest of both should be
consulted; is it, my good friend?”</p>

<p>“What then?” demanded Monks, sulkily.
“I saw it was not easy to train him to the
business,” replied the Jew; “he was not like
other boys in the same circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Curse him, no!” muttered the man, “or
he would have been a thief long ago.”</p>

<p>“I had no hold upon him to make him
worse,” pursued the Jew, anxiously watching
the countenance of his companion. “His hand
was not in; I had nothing to frighten him
with, which we always must have in the beginning,
or we labour in vain. What could I
do? Send him out with the Dodger and Charley?
We had enough of that at first, my dear;
I trembled for us all.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> was not my doing,” observed Monks.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear!” renewed the Jew, “and
I don’t quarrel with it now, because, if it had
never happened, you might never have clapped
eyes upon the boy to notice him, and so led to
the discovery that it was him you were looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for. Well; I got him back for you by means
of the girl, and then <i>she</i> begins to favour
him.”</p>

<p>“Throttle the girl!” said Monks, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Why, we can’t afford to do that just now,
my dear,” replied the Jew, smiling; “and, besides,
that sort of thing is not in our way, or
one of these days I might be glad to have it
done. I know what these girls are, Monks,
well. As soon as the boy begins to harden,
she’ll care no more for him than for a block of
wood. You want him made a thief: if he is
alive, I can make him one from this time; and
if—if—” said the Jew, drawing nearer to the
other,—“it’s not likely, mind,—but if the
worst comes to the worst, and he is dead——”</p>

<p>“It’s no fault of mine if he is!” interposed
the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping
the Jew’s arm with trembling hands. “Mind
that, Fagin; I had no hand in it. Anything
but his death, I told you from the first. I wont
shed blood; it’s always found out, and haunts a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not
the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal
den!—what’s that?”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the Jew, grasping the coward
round the body with both arms as he sprung to
his feet. “Where?”</p>

<p>“Yonder!” replied the man, glaring at the
opposite wall. “The shadow—I saw the shadow
of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass
along the wainscot like a breath!”</p>

<p>The Jew released his hold, and they rushed
tumultuously from the room. The candle,
wasted by the draught, was standing where it
had been placed, and shewed them the empty
staircase, and their own white faces. They listened
intently, but a profound silence reigned
throughout the house.</p>

<p>“It’s your fancy,” said the Jew, taking up
the light, and turning to his companion.</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I saw it!” replied Monks, trembling
violently. “It was bending forward when
I saw it first, and when I spoke it darted
away.”</p>

<p>The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
face of his associate, and, telling him he could
follow if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They
looked into all the rooms; they were cold,
bare, and empty. They descended into the passage,
and thence into the cellars below. The
green damp hung upon the low walls, and the
tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the
light; but all was still as death.</p>

<p>“What do you think now?” said the
Jew, when they had regained the passage.
“Besides ourselves, there’s not a creature in
the house except Toby and the boys, and
they’re safe enough. See here!”</p>

<p>As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth
two keys from his pocket; and explained, that
when he first went down stairs he had locked
them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.</p>

<p>This accumulated testimony effectually staggered
Mr. Monks. His protestations had
gradually become less and less vehement as
they proceeded in their search without making
any discovery; and now he gave vent to several
very grim laughs, and confessed it could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
have been his excited imagination. He declined
any renewal of the conversation, however, for
that night, suddenly remembering that it was
past one o’clock: and so the amiable couple
parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER,
WHICH DESERTED A LADY MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it would be by no means seemly in an
humble author to keep so mighty a personage
as a beadle waiting with his back to the
fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up
under his arms, until such time as it might suit
his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would
still less become his station, or his gallantry, to
involve in the same neglect a lady on whom
that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness
and affection, and in whose ear he had
whispered sweet words, which, coming from
such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of
maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the
faithful historian whose pen traces these words,
trusting that he knows his place, and entertains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a becoming reverence for those upon earth to
whom high and important authority is delegated,
hastens to pay them that respect which
their position demands, and to treat them with all
that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank
and (by consequence) great virtues imperatively
claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed,
he had purposed to introduce in this place a dissertation
touching the divine right of beadles,
and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can
do no wrong, which could not fail to have been
both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded
reader, but which he is unfortunately
compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone
to some more convenient and fitting opportunity;
on the arrival of which, he will be
prepared to shew, that a beadle properly constituted,—that
is to say, a parochial beadle, attached
to a parochial workhouse, and attending
in his official capacity the parochial church,—is,
in right and virtue of his office, possessed of
all the excellences and best qualities of humanity;
and that to none of those excellences
can mere companies’ beadles, or court-of-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the
last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree),
lay the remotest sustainable claim.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble had recounted the tea-spoons,
re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection
of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a
nicety the exact condition of the furniture down
to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and
had repeated each process full half-a-dozen
times, before he began to think that it was
time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets
thinking; and, as there were no sounds of
Mrs. Corney’s approach, it occurred to Mr.
Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous
way of spending the time, if he were further
to allay his curiosity by a cursory glance at
the interior of Mrs. Corney’s chest of drawers.</p>

<p>Having listened at the keyhole to assure himself
that nobody was approaching the chamber,
Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded
to make himself acquainted with the
contents of the three long drawers, which,
being filled with various garments of good
fashion and texture, carefully preserved between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried
lavender, seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.
Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand
corner drawer (in which was the key), and
beholding therein a small padlocked box, which,
being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of
the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with
a stately walk to the fireplace, and, resuming his
old attitude, said, with a grave and determined
air, “I’ll do it!” He followed up this remarkable
declaration by shaking his head in a waggish
manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating
with himself for being such a pleasant
dog, and then took a view of his legs in
profile with much seeming pleasure and interest.</p>

<p>He was still placidly engaged in this latter
survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the
room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a
chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with
one hand, placed the other over her heart, and
gasped for breath.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble, stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
over the matron, “what is this, ma’am? has
anything happened, ma’am? Pray answer me;
I’m on—on—” Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could
not immediately think of the word “tenterhooks,”
so he said, “broken bottles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bumble!” cried the lady, “I have
been so dreadfully put out!”</p>

<p>“Put out, ma’am!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble;
“who has dared to—? I know!” said Mr.
Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty,
“this is them wicious paupers!”</p>

<p>“It’s dreadful to think of!” said the lady,
shuddering.</p>

<p>“Then <i>don’t</i> think of it, ma’am,” rejoined
Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” whimpered the lady.</p>

<p>“Then take something, ma’am,” said Mr.
Bumble, soothingly. “A little of the wine?”</p>

<p>“Not for the world!” replied Mrs. Corney.
“I couldn’t,—oh! The top shelf in the right-hand
corner—oh!” Uttering these words, the
good lady pointed distractedly to the cupboard,
and underwent a convulsion from internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet, and,
snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the
shelf, thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup
with its contents, and held it to the lady’s
lips.</p>

<p>“I’m better now,” said Mrs. Corney, falling
back, after drinking half of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the
ceiling in thankfulness, and, bringing them
down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to
his nose.</p>

<p>“Peppermint,” explained Mrs. Corney, in a
faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she
spoke. “Try it; there’s a little—a little something
else in it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a
doubtful look; smacked his lips, took another
taste, and put the cup down empty.</p>

<p>“It is very comforting,” said Mrs. Corney.</p>

<p>“Very much so indeed, ma’am,” said the
beadle. As he spoke, he drew a chair beside
the matron, and tenderly inquired what had
happened to distress her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Mrs. Corney. “I am a
foolish, excitable, weak creetur.”</p>

<p>“Not weak, ma’am,” retorted Mr. Bumble,
drawing his chair a little closer. “Are you a
weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?”</p>

<p>“We are all weak creeturs,” said Mrs.
Corney, laying down a general principle.</p>

<p>“So we are,” said the beadle.</p>

<p>Nothing was said on either side for a minute
or two afterwards; and by the expiration of
that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position
by removing his left arm from the back of
Mrs. Corney’s chair, where it had previously
rested, to Mrs. Corney’s apron-string, round
which it gradually became intwined.</p>

<p>“We are all weak creeturs,” said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney sighed.</p>

<p>“Dont sigh, Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Mrs. Corney. And
she sighed again.</p>

<p>“This is a very comfortable room, ma’am,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
said Mr. Bumble, looking round. “Another
room and this, ma’am, would be a complete
thing.”</p>

<p>“It would be too much for one,” murmured
the lady.</p>

<p>“But not for two, ma’am,” rejoined Mr.
Bumble, in soft accents. “Eh, Mrs. Corney?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney drooped her head when the
beadle said this, and the beadle drooped his to
get a view of Mrs. Corney’s face. Mrs. Corney,
with great propriety, turned her head away, and
released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief,
but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.
Bumble.</p>

<p>“The board allow you coals, don’t they, Mrs.
Corney?” inquired the beadle, affectionately
pressing her hand.</p>

<p>“And candles,” replied Mrs. Corney, slightly
returning the pressure.</p>

<p>“Coals, candles, and house-rent free,” said
Mr. Bumble. “Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a angel
you are!”</p>

<p>The lady was not proof against this burst of
feeling. She sunk into Mr. Bumble’s arms;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and that gentleman, in his agitation, imprinted
a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.</p>

<p>“Such porochial perfection!” exclaimed Mr.
Bumble, rapturously. “You know that Mr.
Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.</p>

<p>“He can’t live a week, the doctor says,”
pursued, Mr. Bumble. “He is the master of
this establishment; his death will cause a
wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up. Oh
Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!
What a opportunity for a joining of hearts and
housekeeping!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney sobbed.</p>

<p>“The little word?” said Mr. Bumble, bending
over the bashful beauty—“the one little,
little, little word, my blessed Corney?”</p>

<p>“Ye—ye—yes!” sighed out the matron.</p>

<p>“One more,” pursued the beadle; “compose
your darling feelings for only one more.
When is it to come off?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak, and
twice failed. At length, summoning up courage,
she threw her arms round Mr. Bumble’s neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased,
and that he was “a irresistible duck.”</p>

<p>Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily
arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in
another tea-cupful of the peppermint mixture,
which was rendered the more necessary by the
flutter and agitation of the lady’s spirits. While
it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.
Bumble with the old woman’s decease.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said that gentleman, sipping
his peppermint “I’ll call at Sowerberry’s as
I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow
morning. Was it that as frightened you,
love?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything particular, dear,” said
the lady, evasively.</p>

<p>“It must have been something, love,” urged
Mr. Bumble. “Wont you tell your own B.?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” rejoined the lady; “one of
these days,—after we’re married, dear.”</p>

<p>“After we’re married!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble.
“It wasn’t any impudence from any of
them male paupers as——”</p>

<p>“No, no, love!” interposed the lady, hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I thought it was,” continued Mr. Bumble,—“if
I thought any one of ’em had dared
to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance——”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t have dared to do it, love,”
responded the lady.</p>

<p>“They had better not!” said Mr. Bumble,
clenching his fist. “Let me see any man,
porochial, or extra-porochial, as would presume
to do it, and I can tell him that he wouldn’t do
it a second time!”</p>

<p>Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation,
this might have sounded as no very high
compliment to the lady’s charms; but, as Mr.
Bumble accompanied the threat with many
warlike gestures, she was much touched with
this proof of his devotion, and protested, with
great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.</p>

<p>The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and
put on his cocked-hat, and having exchanged
a long and affectionate embrace with his future
partner, once again braved the cold wind of the
night; merely pausing for a few minutes in the
male paupers’ ward to abuse them a little, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the view of satisfying himself that he could fill
the office of workhouse-master with needful
acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr.
Bumble left the building with a light heart and
bright visions of his future promotion, which
served to occupy his mind until he reached the
shop of the undertaker.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone
out to tea and supper, and Noah Claypole not
being at any time disposed to take upon himself
a greater amount of physical exertion than is
necessary to a convenient performance of the
two functions of eating and drinking, the shop
was not closed, although it was past the usual
hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with
his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting
no attention, and beholding a light
shining through the glass-window of the little
parlour, at the back of the shop, he made bold
to peep in and see what was going forward;
and, when he saw what <i>was</i> going forward, he
was not a little surprised.</p>

<p>The cloth was laid for supper, and the table
was covered with bread and butter, plates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
glasses, a porter-pot, and a wine-bottle. At the
upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled
negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown
over one of the arms, an open clasp-knife in one
hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the
other; close beside him stood Charlotte, opening
oysters from a barrel, which Mr. Claypole
condescended to swallow with remarkable
avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the
region of the young gentleman’s nose, and a
kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that
he was in a slight degree intoxicated; and these
symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish
with which he took his oysters, for which nothing
but a strong appreciation of their cooling
properties, in cases of internal fever, could have
sufficiently accounted.</p>

</div>

<p>“Here’s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!”
said Charlotte; “try him, do; only this one.”</p>

<p>“What a delicious thing is a oyster!” remarked
Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it.
“What a pity it is a number of ’em should
ever make you feel uncomfortable, isn’t it,
Charlotte?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s quite a cruelty,” said Charlotte.</p>

<p>“So it is,” acquiesced Mr. Claypole. “A’n’t
yer fond of oysters?”</p>

<p>“Not overmuch,” replied Charlotte. “I like
to see you eat ’em, Noah dear, better than eating
them myself.”</p>

<p>“Lor’!” said Noah, reflectively; “how
queer!”</p>

<p>“Have another,” said Charlotte. “Here’s
one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!”</p>

<p>“I can’t manage any more,” said Noah.
“I’m very sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and
I’ll kiss yer.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Mr. Bumble, bursting into
the room. “Say that again, sir.”</p>

<p>Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face
in her apron; while Mr. Claypole, without
making any further change in his position than
suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at
the beadle in drunken terror.</p>

<p>“Say it again, you vile, owdacious fellow!”
said Mr. Bumble. “How dare you mention
such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage
him, you insolent minx? Kiss her!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.
“Faugh!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to do it!” said Noah, blubbering.
“She’s always a-kissing of me, whether
I like it, or not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Noah!” cried Charlotte, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Yer are, yer know yer are!” retorted Noah.
“She’s always a-doing of it, Mr. Bumble, sir;
she chucks me under the chin, please sir, and
makes all manner of love!”</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. “Take
yourself down stairs, ma’am. Noah, you shut
up the shop, and say another word till your
master comes home at your peril; and, when he
does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble
said he was to send a old woman’s shell after
breakfast to-morrow morning. Do you hear,
sir? Kissing!” cried Mr. Bumble, holding up
his hands. “The sin and wickedness of the
lower orders in this porochial district is frightful;
if parliament don’t take their abominable
courses under consideration, this country’s
ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone
for ever!” With these words, the beadle strode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker’s
premises.</p>

<p>And now that we have accompanied him so
far on his road home, and have made all necessary
preparations for the old woman’s funeral,
let us set on foot a few inquiries after young
Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still
lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS
ADVENTURES.</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Wolves</span> tear your throats!” muttered
Sikes, grinding his teeth. “I wish I was among
some of you; you’d howl the hoarser for it.”</p>

<p>As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with
the most desperate ferocity that his desperate
nature was capable of, he rested the body of the
wounded boy across his bended knee, and
turned his head for an instant to look back at
his pursuers.</p>

<p>There was little to be made out in the mist
and darkness; but the loud shouting of men
vibrated through the air, and the barking of the
neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the
alarm-bell, resounded in every direction.</p>

<p>“Stop, you white-livered hound!” cried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making
the best use of his long legs, was already ahead,—“stop!”</p>

<p>The repetition of the word brought Toby to
a dead stand-still, for he was not quite satisfied
that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot,
and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.</p>

<p>“Bear a hand with the boy,” roared Sikes,
beckoning furiously to his confederate. “Come
back!”</p>

<p>Toby made a show of returning, but ventured,
in a low voice, broken for want of breath,
to intimate considerable reluctance as he came
slowly along.</p>

<p>“Quicker!” cried Sikes, laying the boy in a
dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol
from his pocket. “Dont play the booby with
me.”</p>

<p>At this moment the noise grew louder, and
Sikes, again looking round, could discern that
the men who had given chase were already
climbing the gate of the field in which he stood,
and that a couple of dogs were some paces in
advance of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all up, Bill,” cried Toby; “drop the
kid, and show ’em your heels.” With this parting
advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance
of being shot by his friend to the certainty of
being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail,
and darted off at full speed. Sikes clenched
his teeth, took one look round, threw over the
prostrate form of Oliver the cape in which he
had been hurriedly muffled, ran along the front
of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of
those behind from the spot where the boy lay,
paused for a second before another hedge
which met it at right angles, and whirling his
pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound,
and was gone.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, there!” cried a tremulous voice in
the rear. “Pincher, Neptune, come here, come
here!”</p>

<p>The dogs, which, in common with their masters,
seemed to have no particular relish for the
sport in which they were engaged, readily answered
to this command: and three men, who
had by this time advanced some distance into
the field, stopped to take counsel together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my
<i>orders</i>, is,” said the fattest man of the party,
“that we ’mediately go home again.”</p>

<p>“I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable
to Mr. Giles,” said a shorter man, who was
by no means of a slim figure, and who was very
pale in the face, and very polite, as frightened
men frequently are.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wish to appear ill-mannered,
gentlemen,” said the third, who had called the
dogs back, “Mr. Giles ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the shorter man; “and
whatever Mr. Giles says it isn’t our place to
contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation,—thank
my stars, I know my sitiwation.” To
tell the truth, the little man <i>did</i> seem to know
his situation, and to know perfectly well that it
was by no means a desirable one, for his teeth
chattered in his head as he spoke.</p>

<p>“You are afraid, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles.</p>

<p>“I a’n’t,” said Brittles.</p>

<p>“You are,” said Giles.</p>

<p>“You’re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,” said Brittles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a lie, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles.</p>

<p>Now, these four retorts arose from Mr.
Giles’s taunt, and Mr. Giles’s taunt had arisen
from his indignation at having the responsibility
of going home again imposed upon himself
under cover of a compliment. The third
man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,” said he,
“we’re all afraid.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, sir,” said Mr. Giles,
who was the palest of the party.</p>

<p>“So I do,” replied the man. “It’s natural
and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances.
<i>I</i> am.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Brittles; “only there’s no
call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.”</p>

<p>These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles,
who at once owned that <i>he</i> was afraid; upon
which they all three faced about and ran back
again with the completest unanimity, till Mr.
Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party,
and was encumbered with a pitchfork) most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
handsomely insisted upon stopping to make an
apology for his hastiness of speech.</p>

<p>“But it’s wonderful,” said Mr. Giles, when
he had explained, “what a man will do when
his blood is up. I should have committed murder,
I know I should, if we’d caught one of the
rascals.”</p>

<p>As the other two were impressed with a similar
presentiment, and their blood, like his, had
all gone down again, some speculation ensued
upon the cause of this sudden change in their
temperament.</p>

<p>“I know what it was,” said Mr. Giles; “it
was the gate.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if it was,” exclaimed
Brittles, catching at the idea.</p>

<p>“You may depend upon it,” said Giles, “that
that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. I
felt all mine suddenly going away as I was
climbing over it.”</p>

<p>By a remarkable coincidence the other two
had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation
at that precise moment; so that it was
quite conclusive that it was the gate, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as there was no doubt regarding the time at
which the change had taken place, because all
three remembered that they had come in sight
of the robbers at the very instant of its occurrence.</p>

<p>This dialogue was held between the two men
who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling
tinker, who had been sleeping in an outhouse,
and who had been roused, together with his two
mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles
acted in the double capacity of butler and steward
to the old lady of the mansion, and Brittles
was a lad of all-work, who, having entered her
service a mere child, was treated as a promising
young boy still, though he was something past
thirty.</p>

<p>Encouraging each other with such converse
as this, but keeping very close together notwithstanding,
and looking apprehensively round
whenever a fresh gust rattled through the
boughs, the three men hurried back to a tree
behind which they had left their lantern, lest its
light should inform the thieves in what direction
to fire. Catching up the light, they made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the best of their way home, at a good round
trot; and long after their dusky forms had
ceased to be discernible, it might have been
seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like
some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere
through which it was swiftly borne.</p>

<p>The air grew colder as day came slowly on,
and the mist rolled along the ground like a
dense cloud of smoke; the grass was wet, the
pathways and low places were all mire and
water, and the damp breath of an unwholesome
wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning.
Still Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the
spot where Sikes had left him.</p>

<p>Morning drew on apace; the air became more
sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue—the
death of night rather than the birth of day—glimmered
faintly in the sky. The objects
which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness
grew more and more defined, and gradually
resolved into their familiar shapes. The rain
came down thick and fast, and pattered noisily
among the leafless bushes. But Oliver felt it
not, as it beat against him, for he still lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed
of clay.</p>

<p>At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness
that prevailed, and uttering it, the boy
awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a
shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side, and
the bandage was saturated with blood. He was
so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into
a sitting posture, and when he had done so, he
looked feebly round for help, and groaned with
pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and
exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright,
but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate
on the ground.</p>

<p>After a short return of the stupor in which
he had been so long plunged, Oliver, urged by
a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed
to warn him that if he lay there he must surely
die, got upon his feet and essayed to walk. His
head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro
like a drunken man; but he kept up nevertheless,
and, with his head drooping languidly on
his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not
whither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, hosts of bewildering and confused
ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed
to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit,
who were angrily disputing, for the very words
they said sounded in his ears: and when he
caught his own attention, as it were, by making
some violent effort to save himself from falling,
he found that he was talking to them. Then
he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as they
had done the previous day, and as shadowy
people passed them by, he felt the robber’s
grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started
back at the report of fire-arms, and there rose
into the air loud cries and shouts; lights
gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and
tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly
away. Through all these rapid visions
there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness
of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.</p>

<p>Thus he staggered on, creeping almost mechanically
between the bars of gates, or through
hedge-gaps, as they came in his way, until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reached a road; and here the rain began to fall
so heavily that it roused him.</p>

<p>He looked about, and saw that at no great
distance there was a house, which perhaps he
could reach. Seeing his condition, they might
have compassion on him, and if they did not,
it would be better, he thought, to die near
human beings than in the lonely open fields.
He summoned up all his strength for one last
trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling
came over him that he had seen it before. He
remembered nothing of its details, but the
shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar
to him.</p>

<p>That garden-wall! On the grass inside he
had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed
the two men’s mercy. It was the very same
house they had attempted to rob.</p>

<p>Oliver felt such fear come over him when he
recognised the place, that, for the instant, he
forgot the agony of his wound, and thought
only of flight. Flight! He could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
stand; and if he were in full possession of all
the best powers of his slight and youthful
frame, where could he fly to? He pushed
against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and
swung open on its hinges. He tottered across
the lawn, climbed the steps, knocked faintly at
the door, and his whole strength failing him,
sunk down against one of the pillars of the little
portico.</p>

<p>It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles,
Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves
after the fatigues and terrors of the night,
with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that
it was Mr. Giles’s habit to admit to too great
familiarity the humbler servants, towards whom
it was rather his wont to deport himself with a
lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could
not fail to remind them of his superior position
in society. But death, fires, and burglary make
all men equals; and Mr. Giles sat with his
legs stretched out before the kitchen fender,
leaning his left arm on the table, while, with
his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
minute account of the robbery, to which his
hearers (but especially the cook and housemaid,
who were of the party) listened with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>“It was about half-past two,” said Mr. Giles,
“or I wouldn’t swear that it mightn’t have been
a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning
round in my bed, as it might be so, (here
Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and
pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to
imitate bedclothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.”</p>

<p>At this point of the narrative, the cook turned
pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door,
who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who
pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>“—Heerd a noise,” continued Mr. Giles. “I
says, at first, ‘This is illusion;’ and was composing
myself off to sleep, when I heerd the
noise again, distinct.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a noise?” asked the cook.</p>

<p>“A kind of a busting noise,” replied Mr.
Giles, looking round him.</p>

<p>“More like the noise of powdering an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,” suggested
Brittle.</p>

<p>“It was, when <i>you</i> heerd, sir,” rejoined Mr.
Giles; “but, at this time, it had a busting
sound. I turned down the clothes,” continued
Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, “sat up in
bed, and listened.”</p>

<p>The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated,
“Lor!” and drew their chairs closer
together.</p>

<p>“I heerd it now, quite apparent,” resumed
Mr. Giles. “‘Somebody,’ I says, ‘is forcing
of a door, or window; what’s to be done? I’ll
call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him
from being murdered in his bed, or his throat,’
I says, ‘may be cut from his right ear to his left,
without his ever knowing it.’”</p>

<p>Here all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who
fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him,
with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive
of the most unmitigated horror.</p>

<p>“I tossed off the clothes,” said Giles, throwing
away the table-cloth, and looking very hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at the cook and housemaid, “got softly out of
bed, drew on a pair of—”</p>

<p>“Ladies present, Mr. Giles,” murmured the
tinker.</p>

<p>“—Of <i>shoes</i>, sir,” said Giles, turning upon
him, and laying great emphasis on the word,
“seized the loaded pistol that always goes up
stairs with the plate-basket, and walked on
tiptoes to his room. ‘Brittles,’ I says, when I
had woke him, ‘don’t be frightened!’”</p>

<p>“So you did,” observed Brittles, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“‘We’re dead men, I think, Brittles,’ I
says,” continued Giles; “‘but don’t be under
any alarm.’”</p>

<p>“<i>Was</i> he frightened?” asked the cook.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied Mr. Giles. “He
was as firm—ah! pretty near as firm as I
was.”</p>

<p>“I should have died at once, I’m sure, if it
had been me,” observed the housemaid.</p>

<p>“You’re a woman,” retorted Brittles, plucking
up a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Brittles is right,” said Mr. Giles, nodding
his head, approvingly; “from a woman nothing
else was to be expected. We, being men, took a
dark lantern, that was standing on Brittles’s hob,
and groped our way down stairs in the pitch
dark,—as it might be so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken
two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his
description with appropriate action, when he
started violently, in common with the rest of the
company, and hurried back to his chair. The
cook and housemaid screamed.</p>

<p>“It was a knock,” said Mr. Giles, assuming
perfect serenity; “open the door, somebody.”</p>

<p>Nobody moved.</p>

<p>“It seems a strange sort of thing, a knock
coming at such a time in the morning,” said Mr.
Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded
him, and looking very blank himself;
“but the door must be opened. Do you hear,
somebody?”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles;
but that young man being naturally modest,
probably considered himself nobody, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
held that the inquiry could not have any application
to him: at all events, he tendered no
reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance
at the tinker, but he had suddenly fallen asleep.
The women were out of the question.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<img src="images/i162.jpg" width="399" height="500" alt="Oliver collapsed on doorstep with the group looking out of the door at him" />
<div class="caption"><i>Oliver Twist at M<sup>rs.</sup> Maylie’s door.</i></div>
</div>

<p>“If Brittles would rather open the door in
the presence of witnesses,” said Mr. Giles,
after a short silence, “I am ready to make
one.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the tinker, waking up as
suddenly as he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the
party being somewhat reassured by the discovery
(made on throwing open the shutters) that
it was now broad day, took their way up stairs,
with the dogs in front, and the two women, who
were afraid to stop below, bringing up the rear.
By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very
loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside
that they were strong in numbers; and by a
master-stroke of policy, originating in the brain
of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs’ tails
were well pinched in the hall to make them
bark savagely.</p>

<p>These precautions having been taken, Mr.
Giles held on fast by the tinker’s arm (to prevent
his running away, as he pleasantly said),
and gave the word of command to open the
door. Brittles obeyed, and the group, peeping
timorously over each other’s shoulders, beheld
no more formidable object than poor little
Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who
raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their
compassion.</p>

<p>“A boy!” exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly
pushing the tinker into the background.
“What’s the matter with the—eh?—Why—Brittles—look
here—don’t you know?”</p>

<p>Brittles, who had got behind the door to
open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered
a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy
by one leg and one arm—fortunately not the
broken limb—lugged him straight into the hall,
and deposited him at full length on the ground
thereof.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” bawled Giles, calling, in a
great state of excitement, up the staircase;
“here’s one of the thieves, ma’am! Here’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a><br /><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
thief, miss—wounded, miss! I shot him, miss;
and Brittles held the light.”</p>

<p>“In a lantern, miss,” cried Brittles, applying
one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his
voice might travel the better.</p>

<p>The two women-servants ran up stairs to
carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured
a robber; and the tinker busied himself
in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he
should die before he could be hung. In the
midst of all this noise and commotion, there was
heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in
an instant.</p>

<p>“Giles!” whispered the voice from the stair-head.</p>

<p>“I’m here, miss,” replied Mr. Giles. “Don’t
be frightened, miss; I ain’t much injured. He
didn’t make a very desperate resistance, miss;
I was soon too many for him.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” replied the young lady; “you
frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did.
Is the poor creature much hurt?”</p>

<p>“Wounded desperate, miss,” replied Giles,
with indescribable complacency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“He looks as if he was a-going, miss,”
bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before.
“Wouldn’t you like to come and look at him,
miss, in case he should—?”</p>

<p>“Hush, pray, there’s a good man!” rejoined
the young lady. “Wait quietly one instant,
while I speak to aunt.”</p>

<p>With a footstep as soft and gentle as the
voice, the speaker tripped away, and soon retained,
with the direction that the wounded
person was to be carried carefully up stairs to
Mr. Giles’s room, and that Brittles was to
saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to
Chertsey, from which place he was to despatch,
with all speed, a constable and doctor.</p>

<p>“But won’t you take one look at him, first,
miss?” asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as
if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage that
he had skilfully brought down. “Not one
little peep, miss?”</p>

<p>“Not now for the world,” replied the young
lady. “Poor fellow! oh! treat him kindly,
Giles, if it is only for my sake!”</p>

<p>The old servant looked up at the speaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as she turned away, with a glance as proud and
admiring as if she had been his own child.
Then bending over Oliver, he helped to carry
him up stairs with the care and solicitude of a
woman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF
THE HOUSE TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED, AND RELATES
WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF HIM.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a handsome room—though its furniture
had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort
than of modern elegance—there sat two ladies
at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles,
dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of
black, was in attendance upon them. He had
taken his station some half-way between the
sideboard and the breakfast-table, and with his
body drawn up to its full height, his head
thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on
one side, his left leg advanced, and his right
hand thrust into his waistcoat, while his left
hung down by his side, grasping a waiter,
looked like one who laboured under a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.</p>

<p>Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in
years, but the high-backed oaken chair in which
she sat was not more upright than she. Dressed
with the utmost nicety and precision, in a
quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some
slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which
rather served to point the old style pleasantly
than to impair its effect, she sat in a stately
manner with her hands folded on the table
before her, and her eyes, of which age had
dimmed but little of their brightness, attentively
fixed upon her young companion.</p>

<p>The younger lady was in the lovely bloom
and spring-time of womanhood; at that age
when, if ever angels be for God’s good purposes
enthroned in mortal forms, they may
be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such
as hers.</p>

<p>She was not past seventeen. Cast in so
slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle,
so pure and beautiful, that earth seemed
not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
companions. The very intelligence that shone
in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her
noble head, seemed scarcely of her age or of
the world; and yet the changing expression of
sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights
that played about the face and left no shadow
there; above all, the smile—the cheerful, happy
smile—were intwined with the best sympathies
and affections of our nature.</p>

<p>She was busily engaged in the little offices of
the table, and chancing to raise her eyes as the
elder lady was regarding her, playfully put back
her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead,
and threw into one beaming look such a
gush of affection and artless loveliness, that
blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon
her.</p>

<p>The elder lady smiled; but her heart was
full, and she brushed away a tear as she
did so.</p>

<p>“And Brittles has been gone upwards of an
hour, has he?” asked the old lady, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“An hour and twelve minutes, ma’am,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch,
which he drew forth by a black ribbon.</p>

<p>“He is always slow,” remarked the old
lady.</p>

<p>“Brittles always was a slow boy, ma’am,”
replied the attendant. And seeing, by-the-by,
that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards
of thirty years, there appeared no great probability
of his ever being a fast one.</p>

<p>“He gets worse instead of better, I think,”
said the elder lady.</p>

<p>“It is very inexcusable in him if he stops
to play with any other boys,” said the young
lady, smiling.</p>

<p>Mr. Giles was apparently considering the
propriety of indulging in a respectful smile
himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate,
out of which there jumped a fat gentleman,
who ran straight up to the door, and
getting quickly into the house by some mysterious
process, burst into the room, and nearly
overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table
together.</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the fat gentleman. “My dear Mrs. Maylie—bless
my soul—in the silence of night, too—I
<i>never</i> heard of such a thing!”</p>

<p>With these expressions of condolence, the
fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and
drawing up a chair, inquired how they found
themselves.</p>

<p>“You ought to be dead—positively dead with
the fright,” said the fat gentleman. “Why
didn’t you send? Bless me, my man should
have come in a minute, and so would I, and
my assistant would have been delighted, or
anybody, I’m sure, under such circumstances;
dear, dear—so unexpected—in the silence of
night, too!”</p>

<p>The doctor seemed especially troubled by the
fact of the robbery having been unexpected,
and attempted in the night-time, as if it were
the established custom of gentlemen in the
housebreaking way to transact business at
noon, and to make an appointment, by the
twopenny post, a day or two previous.</p>

<p>“And you, Miss Rose,” said the doctor,
turning to the young lady, “I——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! very much so, indeed,” said Rose, interrupting
him; “but there is a poor creature
up stairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.”</p>

<p>“Ah! to be sure,” replied the doctor, “so
there is. That was your handiwork, Giles, I
understand.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting
the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and
said that he had had that honour.</p>

<p>“Honour, eh?” said the doctor; “well, I
don’t know; perhaps it’s as honourable to hit a
thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at
twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air,
and you’ve fought a duel, Giles.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment
of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing
his glory, answered respectfully, that it was
not for the like of him to judge about that, but
he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite
party.</p>

<p>“‘Gad, that’s true!” said the doctor. “Where
is he? Shew me the way. I’ll look in again as
I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That’s the little
window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
have believed it.” Talking all the way, he followed
Mr. Giles up stairs; and while he is going
up stairs, the reader may be informed, that
Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood,
known through a circuit of ten miles round as
“the doctor,” had grown fat more from goodhumour
than from good living, and was as kind
and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor,
as will be found in five times that space
by any explorer alive.</p>

<p>The doctor was absent much longer than
either he or the ladies had anticipated. A large
flat box was fetched out of the gig, and a bedroom
bell was rung very often, and the servants
ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which
tokens it was justly concluded that something
important was going on above. At length he
returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry
after his patient, looked very mysterious, and
closed the door carefully.</p>

<p>“This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs.
Maylie,” said the doctor, standing with his
back to the door, as if to keep it shut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is not in danger, I hope?” said the old
lady.</p>

<p>“Why, that would not be an extraordinary
thing, under the circumstances,” replied the
doctor; “though I don’t think he is. Have you
seen this thief?”</p>

<p>“No,” rejoined the old lady.</p>

<p>“Nor heard anything about him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, ma’am,” interposed Mr.
Giles; “but I was going to tell you about him
when Doctor Losberne came in.”</p>

<p>The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not at first
been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that
he had only shot a boy. Such commendations
had been bestowed upon his bravery that he
could not, for the life of him, help postponing
the explanation for a few delicious minutes,
during which he had flourished in the very
zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted
courage.</p>

<p>“Rose wished to see the man,” said Mrs.
Maylie; “but I wouldn’t hear of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humph!” rejoined the doctor. “There’s
nothing very alarming in his appearance. Have
you any objection to see him in my presence?”</p>

<p>“If it be necessary,” replied the old lady,
“certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Then I think it is necessary,” said the
doctor; “at all events, I am quite sure that you
would deeply regret not having done so, if you
postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable
now. Allow me—Miss Rose, will you
permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you
my honour.”</p>

<p>With many more loquacious assurances that
they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect
of the criminal, the doctor drew the young
lady’s arm through one of his, and offering his
disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with
much ceremony and stateliness, up stairs.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the doctor, in a whisper, as he
softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door,
“let us hear what you think of him. He has
not been shaved very recently, but he doesn’t
look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
though—let me see that he is in visiting order
first.”</p>

<p>Stepping before them, he looked into the
room, and motioning them to advance, closed
the door when they had entered, and gently
drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in
lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they
had expected to behold, there lay a mere child,
worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into
a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and
splintered up, was crossed upon his breast, and
his head reclined upon the other, which was
half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over
the pillow.</p>

<p>The honest gentleman held the curtain in his
hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in
silence. Whilst he was watching the patient
thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and
seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered
Oliver’s hair from his face, and as she
stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead.</p>

<p>The boy stirred and smiled in his sleep, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
though those marks of pity and compassion had
awakened some pleasant dream of a love and
affection he had never known; as a strain of
gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent
place, or the odour of a flower, or even the
mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call
up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that
never were, in this life, which vanish like a
breath, and which some brief memory of a
happier existence, long gone by, would seem
to have awakened, for no power of the human
mind can ever recall them.</p>

<p>“What can this mean?” exclaimed the elder
lady. “This poor child can never have been
the pupil of robbers!”</p>

<p>“Vice,” sighed the surgeon, replacing the
curtain, “takes up her abode in many temples;
and who can say that a fair outside shall not
enshrine her?”</p>

<p>“But at so early an age!” urged Rose.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” rejoined the surgeon,
mournfully shaking his head, “crime, like death,
is not confined to the old and withered alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen
victims.”</p>

<p>“But, can you—oh, sir! can you, really believe
that this delicate boy has been the voluntary
associate of the worst outcasts of society?”
said Rose, anxiously.</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head in a manner
which intimated that he feared it was very possible;
and observing that they might disturb
the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.</p>

<p>“But even if he has been wicked,” pursued
Rose, “think how young he is; think that he
may never have known a mother’s love, or even
the comfort of a home, and that ill-usage and
blows, or the want of bread, may have driven
him to herd with the men who have forced him
to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy’s sake,
think of this before you let them drag this sick
child to a prison, which in any case must be
the grave of all his chances of amendment. Oh!
as you love me, and know that I have never felt
the want of parents in your goodness and affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
but that I might have done so, and might
have been equally helpless and unprotected
with this poor child, have pity upon him before
it is too late.”</p>

<p>“My dear love!” said the elder lady, as she
folded the weeping girl to her bosom, “do you
think I would harm a hair of his head?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” replied Rose, eagerly; “not you,
aunt, not you!”</p>

<p>“No,” said the old lady, with a trembling
lip; “my days are drawing to their close, and
may mercy be shewn to me as I shew it to
others. What can I do to save him, sir?”</p>

<p>“Let me think, ma’am,” said the doctor;
“let me think.”</p>

<p>Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his
pockets, and took several turns up and down
the room, often stopping and balancing himself
on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After
various exclamations of “I’ve got it now” and
“no, I haven’t,” and as many renewals of the
walking and frowning, he at length made a dead
halt, and spoke as follows:—</p>

<p>“I think if you give me a full and unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
commission to bully Giles and that little boy,
Brittles, I can manage it. He is a faithful fellow
and an old servant, I know; but you can
make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward
him for being such a good shot besides.
You don’t object to that?”</p>

<p>“Unless there is some other way of preserving
the child,” replied Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>“There is no other,” said the doctor. “No
other, take my word for it.”</p>

<p>“Then aunt invests you with full power,”
said Rose, smiling through her tears; “but
pray don’t be harder upon the poor fellows than
is indispensably necessary.”</p>

<p>“You seem to think,” retorted the doctor,
“that every body is disposed to be hard-hearted
to-day except yourself. I only hope, for the
sake of the rising male sex generally, that you
may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted
a mood by the very first eligible young fellow
who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I
were a young fellow, that I might avail myself
on the spot of such a favourable opportunity
for doing so as the present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are as great a boy as poor Brittles
himself,” returned Rose, blushing.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the doctor, laughing heartily,
“that is no very difficult matter. But to return
to this boy: the great point of our agreement is
yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so,
I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed
constable-fellow down stairs that he
mustn’t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his
life, I think we may converse with him without
danger. Now, I make this stipulation—that I
shall examine him in your presence, and that if
from what he says, we judge, and I can shew to
the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a
real and thorough bad one (which is more than
possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any
further interference on my part, at all events.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, aunt!” entreated Rose.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, aunt!” said the doctor. “Is it a
bargain?”</p>

<p>“He cannot be hardened in vice,” said Rose;
“it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” retorted the doctor; “then so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.”</p>

<p>Finally, the treaty was entered into, and the
parties thereto sat down to wait, with some impatience,
until Oliver should awake.</p>

<p>The patience of the two ladies was destined
to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne
had led them to expect, for hour after hour
passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.
It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted
doctor brought them the intelligence, that he
had at length roused sufficiently to be spoken
to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak
from the loss of blood; but his mind was so
troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that
he deemed it better to give him the opportunity,
than to insist upon his remaining quiet until
next morning, which he should otherwise have
done.</p>

<p>The conference was a long one, for Oliver
told them all his simple history, and was often
compelled to stop by pain and want of strength.
It was a solemn thing to hear, in the darkened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting
a weary catalogue of evils and calamities
which hard men had brought upon him. Oh!
if, when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures,
we bestowed but one thought on the dark
evidences of human error, which, like dense and
heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but
not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance
on our heads—if we heard but one
instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of
dead men’s voices, which no power can stifle,
and no pride shut out, where would be the
injury and injustice, the suffering, misery,
cruelty, and wrong, that each day’s life brings
with it?</p>

<p>Oliver’s pillow was smoothed by woman’s
hands that night, and loveliness and virtue
watched him as he slept. He felt calm and
happy, and could have died without a
murmur.</p>

<p>The momentous interview was no sooner
concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again,
than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning
them for being weak all at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
betook himself down stairs to open upon
Mr. Giles. And finding nobody about the
parlours, it occurred to him, that he could
perhaps originate the proceedings with better
effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he
went.</p>

<p>There were assembled, in that lower house of
the domestic parliament, the women-servants,
Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had
received a special invitation to regale himself
for the remainder of the day, in consideration of
his services), and the constable. The latter
gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large
features, and large half-boots, and looked as if
he had been taking a proportionate allowance of
ale, as indeed he had.</p>

<p>The adventures of the previous night were
still under discussion, for Mr. Giles was expatiating
upon his presence of mind when the
doctor entered; and Mr. Brittles, with a mug
of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything
before his superior said it.</p>

<p>“Sit still,” said the doctor, waving his
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Giles. “Misses
wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I
felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,
and disposed for company, I am taking mine
among ’em here.”</p>

<p>Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the
ladies and gentlemen generally were understood
to express the gratification they derived from
Mr. Giles’s condescension; and Mr. Giles
looked round with a patronising air, as much
as to say, that so long as they behaved properly,
he would never desert them.</p>

<p>“How is the patient to-night, sir?” asked
Giles.</p>

<p>“So-so;” returned the doctor. “I am afraid
you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr.
Giles.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mean to say, sir,” said
Mr. Giles, trembling, “that he’s going to die.
If I thought it, I should never be happy again.
I wouldn’t cut a boy off, no, not even Brittles
here, not for all the plate in the country, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the point,” said the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mysteriously. “Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I hope so,” faltered Mr. Giles,
who had turned very pale.</p>

<p>“And what are you, boy?” said the doctor,
turning sharply upon Brittles.</p>

<p>“Lord bless me, sir!” replied Brittles, starting
violently; “I’m the same as Mr. Giles,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me this,” said the doctor, fiercely,
“both of you—both of you; are you going to
take upon yourselves to swear that that boy up
stairs is the boy that was put through the little
window last night? Out with it! Come; we
are prepared for you.”</p>

<p>The doctor, who was universally considered
one of the best-tempered creatures on earth,
made this demand in such a dreadful tone of
anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably
muddled by ale and excitement, stared
at each other in a state of stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Pay attention to the reply, constable, will
you?” said the doctor, shaking his forefinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with great solemnity of manner, and tapping
the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the
exercise of that worthy’s utmost acuteness.
“Something may come of this before long.”</p>

<p>The constable looked as wise as he could,
and took up his staff of office, which had been
reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.</p>

<p>“It’s a simple question of identity, you will
observe,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is, sir,” replied the constable,
coughing with great violence; for he had
finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had
gone the wrong way.</p>

<p>“Here’s a house broken into,” said the doctor,
“and a couple of men catch one moment’s
glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder-smoke,
and in all the distraction of alarm and
darkness. Here’s a boy comes to that very
same house next morning, and because he happens
to have his arm tied up, these men lay
violent hands upon him; by doing which, they
place his life in great danger, and swear he is
the thief. Now, the question is, whether these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
men are justified by the fact; and if not, what
situation do they place themselves in?”</p>

<p>The constable nodded profoundly, and said,
that if that wasn’t law, he should be glad to
know what was.</p>

<p>“I ask you again,” thundered the doctor,
“are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify
that boy?”</p>

<p>Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles, Mr.
Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable
put his hand behind his ear to catch the
reply; the two women and the tinker leant forward
to listen; and the doctor glanced keenly
round, when a ring was heard at the gate, and
at the same moment, the sound of wheels.</p>

<p>“It’s the runners!” cried Brittles, to all
appearance much relieved.</p>

<p>“The what!” exclaimed the doctor, aghast
in his turn.</p>

<p>“The Bow-street officers, sir,” replied Brittles,
taking up a candle; “me and Mr. Giles
sent for ’em this morning.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Brittles; “I sent a message
up by the coachman, and I only wonder they
weren’t here before, sir.”</p>

<p>“You did, did you? Then confound your
—— slow coaches down here; that’s all,” said
the doctor, walking away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION.</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Who’s</span> that?” inquired Brittles, opening
the door a little way, with the chain up, and
peeping out, shading the candle with his
hand.</p>

<p>“Open the door,” replied a man outside;
“it’s the officers from Bow-street, as was sent
to, to-day.”</p>

<p>Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles
opened the door to its full width, and confronted
a portly man in a great-coat, who
walked in without saying anything more, and
wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly as if he
lived there.</p>

<p>“Just send somebody out to relieve my
mate, will you, young man?” said the officer;
“he’s in the gig minding the prad. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
got a coach’us here that you could put it up in
for five or ten minutes?”</p>

<p>Brittles replying in the affirmative, and
pointing out the building, the portly man
stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped
his companion to put up the gig, while Brittles
lighted them, in a state of great admiration.
This done, they returned to the house, and,
being shewn into a parlour, took off their great-coats
and hats, and shewed like what they were.
The man who had knocked at the door was a
stout personage of middle height, aged about
fifty, with shiny black hair, cropped pretty
close, half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp
eyes. The other was a red-headed, bony man,
in top-boots, with a rather ill-favoured countenance,
and a turned-up, sinister-looking nose.</p>

<p>“Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff
is here, will you?” said the stouter man,
smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of
handcuffs on the table. “Oh! good evening,
master. Can I have a word or two with you in
private, if you please?”</p>

<p>This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
now made his appearance; that gentleman,
motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two
ladies, and shut the door.</p>

<p>“This is the lady of the house,” said Mr.
Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>Mr. Blathers made a bow, and being desired
to sit down, put his hat upon the floor, and,
taking a chair, motioned Duff to do the same.
The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite
so much accustomed to good society, or quite
so much at his ease in it, one of the two, seated
himself, after undergoing several muscular
affections of the limbs, and forced the head of
his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Now, with regard to this here robbery,
master,” said Blathers. “What are the circumstances?”</p>

<p>Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of
gaining time, recounted them at great length,
and with much circumlocution: Messrs. Blathers
and Duff looking very knowing meanwhile,
and occasionally exchanging a nod.</p>

<p>“I can’t say for certain till I see the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of course,” said Blathers; “but my opinion at
once is,—I don’t mind committing myself to
that extent,—that this wasn’t done by a yokel—eh,
Duff?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Duff.</p>

<p>“And, translating the word yokel for the
benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning
to be, that this attempt was not made
by a countryman?” said Mr. Losberne, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“That’s it, master,” replied Blathers. “This
is all about the robbery, is it?”</p>

<p>“All,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Now, what is this about this here boy
that the servants are talking of?” said Blathers.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” replied the doctor. “One
of the frightened servants chose to take it into
his head that he had something to do with this
attempt to break into the house; but it’s nonsense—sheer
absurdity.”</p>

<p>“Wery easy disposed of it is,” remarked
Duff.</p>

<p>“What he says is quite correct,” observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory
way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs,
as if they were a pair of castanets. “Who
is the boy? What account does he give of
himself? Where did he come from? He
didn’t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the doctor, with a
nervous glance at the two ladies. “I know
his whole history;—but we can talk about that
presently. You would like to see the place
where the thieves made their attempt, first, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” rejoined Mr. Blathers. “We
had better inspect the premises first, and examine
the servants arterwards. That’s the usual
way of doing business.”</p>

<p>Lights were then procured, and Messrs. Blathers
and Duff, attended by the native constable,
Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in
short, went into the little room at the end of
the passage and looked out at the window, and
afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and
looked in at the window, and after that, had a
candle handed out to inspect the shutter with, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with,
and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes
with. This done, amidst the breathless interest
of all beholders, they came in again, and Mr.
Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic
representation of their share in the previous
night’s adventures, which they performed
some six times over, contradicting each other
in not more than one important respect the first
time, and in not more than a dozen the last.
This consummation being arrived at, Blathers
and Duff cleared the room, and held a long
council together, compared with which, for
secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great
doctors on the knottiest point in medicine would
be mere child’s play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down
the next room in a very uneasy state, and
Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on with anxious
faces.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” he said, making a halt,
after a great number of very rapid turns, “I
hardly know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Rose, “the poor child’s story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient
to exonerate him.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it, my dear young lady,” said the
doctor, shaking his head. “I don’t think it
would exonerate him either with them or with
legal functionaries of a higher grade. What
is he, after all, they would say?—a runaway.
Judged by mere world considerations and probabilities,
his story is a very doubtful one.”</p>

<p>“You credit it, surely?” interrupted Rose,
in haste.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> believe it, strange as it is, and perhaps
may be an old fool for doing so,” rejoined
the doctor; “but I don’t think it is exactly
the tale for a practised police-officer, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Rose.</p>

<p>“Because, my pretty cross-examiner,” replied
the doctor, “because, viewed with their
eyes, there are so many ugly points about it;
he can only prove the parts that look bad, and
none of those that look well. Confound the
fellows, they <i>will</i> have the why and the wherefore,
and take nothing for granted. On his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
own shewing, you see he has been the companion
of thieves for some time past; he has been
carried to a police-office on a charge of picking
a gentleman’s pocket, and is taken away forcibly
from that gentleman’s house to a place which
he cannot describe or point out, and of the
situation of which he has not the remotest
idea. He is brought down to Chertsey by men
who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him,
whether he will or no, and put through a window
to rob a house, and then, just at the very
moment when he is going to alarm the inmates,
and so do the very thing that would set him all
to rights, there rushes into the way that blundering
dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots
him, as if on purpose to prevent his doing
any good for himself. Don’t you see all this?”</p>

<p>“I see it, of course,” replied Rose, smiling
at the doctor’s impetuosity; “but still I do
not see anything in it to criminate the poor
child.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the doctor; “of course not!
Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never
see, whether for good or bad, more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
side of any question, and that is, invariably,
the one which first presents itself to them.”</p>

<p>Having given vent to this result of experience,
the doctor put his hands into his pockets,
and walked up and down the room with even
greater rapidity than before.</p>

<p>“The more I think of it,” said the doctor,
“the more I see that it will occasion endless
trouble and difficulty to put these men into possession
of the boy’s real story. I am certain it
will not be believed; and even if they can do
nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it
forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts
that will be cast upon it, must interfere materially
with your benevolent plan of rescuing
him from misery.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what is to be done?” cried Rose.
“Dear, dear! why did they send for these
people?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. “I
would not have had them here for the world.”</p>

<p>“All I know is,” said Mr. Losberne at last,
sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness,
“that we must try and carry it off with a bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
face, that’s all. The object is a good one, and
that must be the excuse. The boy has strong
symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no
condition to be talked to any more; that’s one
comfort. We must make the best of it we can;
and if bad is the best, it is no fault of ours.—Come
in.”</p>

<p>“Well, master,” said Blathers, entering the
room, followed by his colleague, and making
the door fast before he said any more. “This
warn’t a put-up thing.”</p>

<p>“And what the devil’s a put-up thing?” demanded
the doctor, impatiently.</p>

<p>“We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,” said
Blathers, turning to them, as if he compassioned
their ignorance, but had a contempt for the
doctor’s, “when the servants is in it.”</p>

<p>“Nobody suspected them, in this case,” said
Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>“Wery likely not, ma’am,” replied Blathers,
“but they might have been in it for all that.”</p>

<p>“More likely on that wery account,” said
Duff.</p>

<p>“We find it was a town hand,” said Blathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
continuing his report; “for the style of work is
first-rate.”</p>

<p>“Wery pretty indeed it is,” remarked Duff,
in an under tone.</p>

<p>“There was two of ’em in it,” continued
Blathers, “and they had a boy with ’em; that’s
plain from the size of the window. That’s all
to be said at present. We’ll see this lad that
you’ve got up stairs at once, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will take something to drink
first, Mrs. Maylie?” said the doctor, his face
brightening up as if some new thought had
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Oh! to be sure!” exclaimed Rose, eagerly.
“You shall have it immediately, if you will.”</p>

<p>“Why, thank you, miss!” said Blathers,
drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; “it’s
dry work, this sort of duty. Anything that’s
handy, miss; don’t put yourself out of the way
on our accounts.”</p>

<p>“What shall it be?” asked the doctor, following
the young lady to the sideboard.</p>

<p>“A little drop of spirits, master, if it’s all the
same,” replied Blathers. “It’s a cold ride from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
London, ma’am; and I always find that spirits
comes home warmer to the feelings.”</p>

<p>This interesting communication was addressed
to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously.
While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor
slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mr. Blathers, not holding his
wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom
between the thumb and forefinger of his left
hand, and placing it in front of his chest; “I
have seen a good many pieces of business like
this, in my time, ladies.”</p>

<p>“That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton,
Blathers,” said Mr. Duff, assisting his
colleague’s memory.</p>

<p>“That was something in this way, warn’t
it?” rejoined Mr. Blathers; “that was done by
Conkey Chickweed, that was.”</p>

<p>“You always gave that to him,” replied
Duff. “It was the Family Pet, I tell you, and
Conkey hadn’t any more to do with it than I
had.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” retorted Mr. Blathers; “I know
better. Do you mind that time Conkey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
robbed of his money, though? What a start
that was! better than any novel-book I ever
see!”</p>

<p>“What was that?” inquired Rose, anxious
to encourage any symptoms of goodhumour in
the unwelcome visiters.</p>

<p>“It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody
would have been down upon,” said Blathers.
“This here Conkey Chickweed——”</p>

<p>“Conkey means Nosey, ma’am,” interposed
Duff.</p>

<p>“Of course the lady knows that, don’t she?”
demanded Mr. Blathers. “Always interrupting,
you are, partner. This here Conkey Chickweed,
miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge
way, and had a cellar, where a good many
young lords went to see cockfighting, and
badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual
manner the sports was conducted in,
for I’ve seen ’em off’en. He warn’t one of the
family at that time, and one night he was
robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven
guineas in a canvass bag, that was stole out of
his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed
himself under the bed, and after committing
the robbery, jumped slap out of window,
which was only a story high. He was wery
quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for
he was woke by the noise, and darting out of
bed, fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused
the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry
directly, and when they came to look about
’em, found that Conkey had hit the robber;
for there was traces of blood all the way to
some palings a good distance off, and there they
lost ’em. However, he had made off with the
blunt, and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed,
licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette
among the other bankrupts; and all manner of
benefits and subscriptions, and I don’t know
what all, was got up for the poor man, who was
in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and
went up and down the streets for three or four
days, pulling his hair off in such a desperate
manner that many people was afraid he might
be going to make away with himself. One day
he come up to the office all in a hurry, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a private interview with the magistrate, who,
after a good deal of talk, rings the bell, and
orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer),
and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in
apprehending the man as robbed his house.
‘I see him, Spyers,’ said Chickweed, ‘pass my
house yesterday morning.’—‘Why didn’t you
up, and collar him?’ says Spyers.—‘I was so
struck all of a heap that you might have fractured
my skull with a toothpick,’ says the poor
man; ‘but we’re sure to have him, for between
ten and eleven o’clock at night he passed again.’
Spyers no sooner heard this than he put some
clean linen and a comb in his pocket, in case he
should have to stop a day or two; and away he
goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house
windows behind a little red curtain,
with his hat on, already to bolt at a moment’s
notice. He was smoking his pipe here late at
night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars
out—‘Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!’ Jem
Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed
tearing down the street full-cry. Away
goes Spyers; on keeps Chickweed; round turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the people; everybody roars out, ‘Thieves!’
and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting all
the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him
a minute as he turns a corner—shoots round—sees
a little crowd—dives in. ‘Which is the
man?’—‘D—me!’ says Chickweed, ‘I’ve lost
him again!’</p>

<p>“It was a remarkable occurrence, but he
warn’t to be seen nowhere, so they went back
to the public-house; and next morning, Spyers
took his old place, and looked out from behind
the curtain for a tall man with a black patch
over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again.
At last, he couldn’t help shutting ’em to ease ’em
a minute, and the very moment he did so, he
hears Chickweed roaring out, ‘Here he is!’ Off he
starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down
the street ahead of him; and after twice as long
a run as the yesterday’s one, the man’s lost
again! This was done once or twice more, till
one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr.
Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who
was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone
mad with grief.”</p>

<p>“What did Jem Spyers say?” inquired the
doctor, who had returned to the room shortly
after the commencement of the story.</p>

<p>“Jem Spyers,” resumed the officer, “for a
long time said nothing at all, and listened to
everything without seeming to, which shewed
he understood his business. But one morning
he walked into the bar, and taking out his
snuff-box, said, ‘Chickweed, I’ve found out
who’s done this here robbery.’—‘Have you?’
said Chickweed. ‘Oh, my dear Spyers, only
let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!
Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain?’—‘Come!’
said Spyers, offering him a
pinch of snuff, ‘none of that gammon! You
did it yourself.’ So he had; and a good bit of
money he had made by it, too; and nobody
would ever have found it out, if he hadn’t been
so precious anxious to keep up appearances;
that’s more!” said Mr. Blathers, putting down
his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very curious, indeed,” observed the doctor.
“Now, if you please, you can walk up
stairs.”</p>

<p>“If <i>you</i> please, sir,” returned Mr. Blathers;
and closely following Mr. Losberne, the two
officers ascended to Oliver’s bedroom, Mr. Giles
preceding the party with a lighted candle.</p>

<p>Oliver had been dozing, but looked worse,
and was more feverish than he had appeared
yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed
to sit up in bed for a minute or so, and looked
at the strangers without at all understanding
what was going forward, and, in fact, without
seeming to recollect where he was, or what had
been passing.</p>

<p>“This,” said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly,
but with great vehemence notwithstanding,
“this is the lad, who, being accidentally
wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass
on Mr. What-d’ye-call-him’s grounds, at
the back here, comes to the house for assistance
this morning, and is immediately laid hold
of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
with the candle in his hand, who has placed his
life in considerable danger, as I can professionally
certify.”</p>

</div>

<p>Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr.
Giles, as he was thus recommended to their
notice; and the bewildered butler gazed from
them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards
Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture
of fear and perplexity.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to deny that, I suppose?”
said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down
again.</p>

<p>“It was all done for the—for the best,
sir!” answered Giles. “I am sure I thought
it was the boy, or I wouldn’t have meddled
with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Thought it was what boy?” inquired the
senior officer.</p>

<p>“The housebreaker’s boy, sir!” replied
Giles. “They—they certainly had a boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you think so now?” inquired
Blathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Think what, now?” replied Giles, looking
vacantly at his questioner.</p>

<p>“Think it’s the same boy, stupid-head?” rejoined
Mr. Blathers, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I really don’t know,” said
Giles, with a rueful countenance. “I couldn’t
swear to him.”</p>

<p>“What do you think?” asked Mr. Blathers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” replied poor
Giles. “I don’t think it is the boy; indeed,
I’m almost certain that it isn’t. You know it
can’t be.”</p>

<p>“Has this man been a-drinking, sir?” inquired
Blathers, turning to the doctor.</p>

<p>“What a precious muddle-headed chap you
are!” said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with
supreme contempt.</p>

<p>Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient’s
pulse during this short dialogue; but he now
rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,
that if the officers had any doubts
upon the subject, they would perhaps like to
step into the next room, and have Brittles before
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned
to a neighbouring apartment, where
Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself
and his respected superior in such a wonderful
maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities
as tended to throw no particular light upon any
thing, save the fact of his own strong mystification;
except, indeed, his declarations that he
should’nt know the real boy if he were put before
him that instant; that he had only taken
Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he
was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously,
admitted in the kitchen that he began
to be very much afraid he had been a little too
hasty.</p>

<p>Among other ingenious surmises, the question
was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had
really hit anybody, and upon examination of
the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it
turned out to have no more destructive loading
than gunpowder and brown paper,—a discovery
which made a considerable impression on every
body but the doctor, who had drawn the ball
about ten minutes before. Upon no one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
however, did it make a greater impression than
on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring for
some hours under the fear of having mortally
wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at
this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.
Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves
very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey
constable in the house, and took up their rest
for that night in the town, promising to return
next morning.</p>

<p>With the next morning there came a rumour
that two men and a boy were in the cage at
Kingston, who had been apprehended overnight
under suspicious circumstances; and to
Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed
accordingly. The suspicious circumstances,
however, resolving themselves, on investigation,
into the one fact, that they had been discovered
sleeping under a haystack, which, although a
great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment,
and is, in the merciful eye of the English
law, and its comprehensive love of all the
king’s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the absence of all other evidence, that the
sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary
accompanied with violence, and have therefore
rendered themselves liable to the punishment of
death—Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back
again as wise as they went.</p>

<p>In short, after some more examination, and a
great deal more conversation, a neighbouring
magistrate was readily induced to take the joint
bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for
Oliver’s appearance if he should ever be called
upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded
with a couple of guineas, returned to town with
divided opinions on the subject of their expedition:
the latter gentleman, on a mature consideration
of all the circumstances, inclining to
the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated
with the Family Pet; and the former
being equally disposed to concede the full merit
of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered
under the united care of Mrs. Maylie,
Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged
with gratitude, be heard in heaven—and if they
be not, what prayers are?—the blessings which
the orphan child called down upon them sunk
into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS
KIND FRIENDS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Oliver’s</span> ailings were neither slight nor few.
In addition to the pain and delay attendant upon
a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold
had brought on fever and ague, which hung
about him for many weeks, and reduced him
sadly. But at length he began, by slow degrees,
to get better, and to be able to say sometimes,
in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the
goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently
he hoped that, when he grew strong and
well again, he could do something to shew his
gratitude; only something which would let
them see the love and duty with which his
breast was full; something, however slight,
which would prove to them that their gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
kindness had not been cast away, but that the
poor boy whom their charity had rescued from
misery, or death, was eager and anxious to serve
them with all his heart and soul.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said Rose, when Oliver had
been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the
words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips,—“you
shall have many opportunities of serving
us, if you will. We are going into the country,
and my aunt intends that you shall accompany
us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the
pleasures and beauties of spring, will restore you
in a few days, and we will employ you in a hundred
ways when you can bear the trouble.”</p>

<p>“The trouble!” cried Oliver. “Oh! dear
lady, if I could but work for you—if I could
only give you pleasure by watering your flowers,
or watching your birds, or running up and down
the whole day long to make you happy, what
would I give to do it?”</p>

<p>“You shall give nothing at all,” said Miss
Maylie, smiling; “for, as I told you before, we
shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you
only take half the trouble to please us that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
promise now, you will make me very happy
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Happy, ma’am!” cried Oliver; “oh, how
kind of you to say so!”</p>

<p>“You will make me happier than I can tell
you,” replied the young lady. “To think that
my dear good aunt should have been the means
of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you
have described to us, would be an unspeakable
pleasure to me; but to know that the object of
her goodness and compassion was sincerely
grateful, and attached in consequence, would
delight me more than you can well imagine.
Do you understand me?” she inquired, watching
Oliver’s thoughtful face.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, ma’am, yes!” replied Oliver,
eagerly; “but I was thinking that I am ungrateful
now.”</p>

<p>“To whom?” inquired the young lady.</p>

<p>“To the kind gentleman and the dear old
nurse who took so much care of me before,”
rejoined Oliver. “If they knew how happy I
am, they would be pleased, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I am sure they would,” rejoined Oliver’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
benefactress; “and Mr. Losberne has already
been kind enough to promise that, when you
are well enough to bear the journey, he will
carry you to see them.”</p>

<p>“Has he, ma’am?” cried Oliver, his face
brightening with pleasure. “I don’t know
what I shall do for joy when I see their kind
faces once again!”</p>

<p>In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered
to undergo the fatigue of this expedition;
and one morning he and Mr. Losberne set out
accordingly in a little carriage which belonged
to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey
Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a
loud exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the boy?” cried
the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. “Do you
see anything—hear anything—feel anything—eh?”</p>

<p>“That, sir,” cried Oliver, pointing out of the
carriage window. “That house!”</p>

<p>“Yes; well, what of it? Stop, coachman.
Pull up here,” cried the doctor. “What of the
house, my man—eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“The thieves—the house they took me to,”
whispered Oliver.</p>

<p>“The devil it is!” cried the doctor. “Halloa,
there! let me out!” But before the
coachman could dismount from his box, he had
tumbled out of the coach, by some means or
other and, running down to the deserted tenement,
began kicking at the door like a madman.</p>

<p>“Halloa!” said a little, ugly hump-backed
man, opening the door so suddenly that the
doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick,
nearly fell forward into the passage. “What’s
the matter here?”</p>

<p>“Matter!” exclaimed the other, collaring
him, without a moment’s reflection. “A good
deal. Robbery is the matter.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be murder, too,” replied the hump-backed
man, coolly, “if you don’t take your
hands off. Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“I hear you,” said the doctor, giving his
captive a hearty shake. “Where’s—confound
the fellow, what’s his rascally name—Sikes—that’s
it. Where’s Sikes, you thief?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The hump-backed man stared as if in excess
of amazement and indignation; and twisting
himself dexterously from the doctor’s grasp,
growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired
into the house. Before he could shut the
door, however, the doctor had passed into the
parlour, without a word of parley. He looked
anxiously round: not an article of furniture,
not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate,
not even the position of the cupboards, answered
Oliver’s description!</p>

<p>“Now,” said the hump-backed man, who had
watched him keenly, “what do you mean by
coming into my house in this violent way? Do
you want to rob me, or to murder me?—which
is it?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know a man come out to do
either in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old
vampire?” said the irritable doctor.</p>

<p>“What do you want, then?” demanded the
hunchback, fiercely. “Will you take yourself
off before I do you a mischief? curse you!”</p>

<p>“As soon as I think proper,” said Mr. Losberne,
looking into the other parlour, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to
Oliver’s account of it. “I shall find you out
some day, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” sneered the ill-favoured cripple.
“If you ever want me, I’m here. I haven’t
lived here mad, and all alone, for five-and-twenty
years, to be scared by you. You shall
pay for this; you shall pay for this.” And so
saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a
hideous yell, and danced upon the ground as if
frantic with rage.</p>

<p>“Stupid enough, this,” muttered the doctor
to himself; “the boy must have made a mistake.
There; put that in your pocket, and shut yourself
up again.” With these words he flung the
hunchback a piece of money, and returned to
the carriage.</p>

<p>The man followed to the chariot door, uttering
the wildest imprecations and curses all the
way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to
the driver, he looked into the carriage, and
eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp
and fierce, and at the same time so furious and
vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
not forget it for months afterwards. He continued
to utter the most fearful imprecations
until the driver had resumed his seat, and when
they were once more on their way, they could
see him some distance behind, beating his feet
upon the ground, and tearing his hair in transports
of frenzied rage.</p>

<p>“I am an ass!” said the doctor, after a long
silence. “Did you know that before, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t forget it another time.”</p>

<p>“An ass,” said the doctor again, after a further
silence of some minutes. “Even if it had
been the right place, and the right fellows had
been there, what could I have done single-handed?
And if I had had assistance, I see no
good that I should have done, except leading
to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement
of the manner in which I have hushed up
this business. That would have served me
right, though. I am always involving myself
in some scrape or other by acting upon
these impulses, and it might have done me
good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the fact was, that the excellent doctor
had never acted upon anything else but impulse
all through his life; and it was no bad compliment
to the nature of the impulses which
governed him, that so far from being involved
in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had
the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew
him. If the truth must be told, he was a little
out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed
in procuring corroborative evidence
of Oliver’s story on the very first occasion on
which he had a chance of obtaining any. He
soon came round again, however, and finding
that Oliver’s replies to his questions were still
as straightforward and consistent, and still
delivered with as much apparent sincerity and
truth, as they had ever been, he made up his
mind to attach full credence to them from that
time forth.</p>

<p>As Oliver knew the name of the street in
which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled
to drive straight thither. When the coach
turned into it, his heart beat so violently that
he could scarcely draw his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, my boy, which house is it?” inquired
Mr. Losberne.</p>

<p>“That, that!” replied Oliver, pointing eagerly
out of the window. “The white house. Oh!
make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I
should die: it makes me tremble so.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” said the good doctor, patting
him on the shoulder. “You will see them
directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you
safe and well.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope so!” cried Oliver. “They were
so good to me; so very very good to me, sir.”</p>

<p>The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that
was the wrong house. The next door. It
went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver
looked up at the windows, with tears of happy
expectation coursing down his face.</p>

<p>Alas! the white house was empty, and there
was a bill in the window—“To Let.”</p>

<p>“Knock at the next door,” cried Mr. Losberne,
taking Oliver’s arm in his. “What has
become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in
the adjoining house, do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The servant did not know; but would go
and inquire. She presently returned, and said,
that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and
gone to the West Indies six weeks before.
Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backwards.</p>

<p>“Has his housekeeper gone, too?” inquired
Mr. Losberne, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir;” replied the servant. “The old
gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman,
a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s, all went together.”</p>

<p>“Then turn towards home again,” said Mr.
Losberne to the driver, “and don’t stop to
bait the horses till you get out of this confounded
London!”</p>

<p>“The book-stall keeper, sir?” said Oliver.
“I know the way there. See him, pray sir!
Do see him!”</p>

<p>“My poor boy, this is disappointment enough
for one day,” said the doctor. “Quite enough
for both of us. If we go to the book-stall
keeper’s we shall certainly find that he is dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
or has set his house on fire, or run away.
No; home again straight!” And in obedience
to the doctor’s first impulse, home they
went.</p>

<p>This bitter disappointment caused Oliver
much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his
happiness; for he had pleased himself many
times during his illness with thinking of all that
Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to
him, and what delight it would be to tell them
how many long days and nights he had passed
in reflecting upon what they had done for him,
and in bewailing his cruel separation from them.
The hope of eventually clearing himself with
them, too, and explaining how he had been
forced away, had buoyed him up and sustained
him under many of his recent trials; and now
the idea that they should have gone so far, and
carried with them the belief that he was an impostor
and a robber,—a belief which might remain
uncontradicted to his dying day,—was
almost more than he could bear.</p>

<p>The circumstance occasioned no alteration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
however, in the behaviour of his benefactors.
After another fortnight, when the fine warm
weather had fairly begun, and every tree and
flower was putting forth its young leaves and
rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting
the house at Chertsey for some months.
Sending the plate which had so excited the
Jew’s cupidity to the banker’s, and leaving
Giles and another servant in care of the
house, they departed for a cottage some distance
in the country, and took Oliver with
them.</p>

<p>Who can describe the pleasure and delight,
the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, which
the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among
the green hills and rich woods, of an inland
village! Who can tell how scenes of peace
and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn
dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry
their own freshness deep into their jaded hearts!
Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets,
through whole lives of toil, and never wished
for change; men, to whom custom has indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
been second nature, and who have come almost
to love each brick and stone that formed the
narrow boundaries of their daily walks—even
they, with the hand of death upon them, have
been known to yearn at last for one short
glimpse of Nature’s face; and carried far from
the scenes of their old pains and pleasures,
have seemed to pass at once into a new state
of being, and crawling forth from day to day to
some green sunny spot, have had such memories
wakened up within them by the mere
sight of sky, and hill, and plain, and glistening
water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has
soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk
into their tombs as peacefully as the sun—whose
setting they watched from their lonely chamber
window but a few hours before—faded from
their dim and feeble sight! The memories
which peaceful country scenes call up are not
of this world, or of its thoughts or hopes.
Their gentle influence may teach us to weave
fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved,
may purify our thoughts, and bear down before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this,
there lingers in the least reflective mind a vague
and half-formed consciousness of having held
such feelings long before in some remote and
distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of
distant times to come, and bends down pride
and worldliness beneath it.</p>

<p>It was a lovely spot to which they repaired,
and Oliver, whose days had been spent among
squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise
and brawling, seemed to enter upon a new
existence there. The rose and honeysuckle
clung to the cottage walls, the ivy crept round
the trunks of the trees, and the garden-flowers
perfumed the air with delicious odours. Hard
by, was a little churchyard: not crowded with
tall, unsightly gravestones, but full of humble
mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss, beneath
which the old people of the village lay at
rest. Oliver often wandered here, and thinking
of the wretched grave in which his mother lay,
would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;
but, as he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he would cease to think of her as lying in
the ground, and weep for her sadly, but without
pain.</p>

<p>It was a happy time. The days were peaceful
and serene, and the nights brought with
them no fear or care; no languishing in a
wretched prison, or associating with wretched
men: nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.
Every morning he went to a white-headed old
gentleman, who lived near the little church, who
taught him to read better, and to write, and
spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that
Oliver could never try enough to please him.
Then he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and
Rose, and hear them talk of books, or perhaps
sit near them, in some shady place, and listen
whilst the young lady read, which he could
have done till it grew too dark to see the letters.
Then he had his own lesson for the next day to
prepare, and at this he would work hard, in a
little room which looked into the garden, till
evening came slowly on, when the ladies would
walk out again, and he with them; listening
with such pleasure to all they said, and so happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
if they wanted a flower that he could climb to
reach, or had forgotten anything he could run
to fetch, that he could never be quick enough
about it. When it became quite dark, and they
returned home, the young lady would sit down
to the piano, and play some melancholy air, or
sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song
which it pleased her aunt to hear. There would
be no candles at such times as these, and Oliver
would sit by one of the windows, listening to
the sweet music, while tears of tranquil joy
stole down his face.</p>

<p>And when Sunday came, how differently the
day was spent from any manner in which he
had ever spent it yet! and how happily, too;
like all the other days in that most happy
time! There was the little church, in the
morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the
windows, the birds singing without, and the
sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch,
and filling the homely building with its fragrance.
The poor people were so neat and
clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it
seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
assembling there together; and though the
singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded
more musical (to Oliver’s ears at least) than
any he had ever heard in church before. Then
there were the walks as usual, and many calls
at the clean houses of the labouring men; and
at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the
Bible, which he had been studying all the week,
and in the performance of which duty he felt
more proud and pleased than if he had been
the clergyman himself.</p>

<p>In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by
six o’clock, roaming the fields and surveying
the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild
flowers, with which he would return laden
home, and which it took great care and consideration
to arrange, to the best advantage, for
the embellishment of the breakfast-table. There
was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie’s
birds, with which Oliver—who had been studying
the subject under the able tuition of the
village clerk—would decorate the cages in the
most approved taste. When the birds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
made all spruce and smart for the day, there
was usually some little commission of charity
to execute in the village; or, failing that, there
was always something to do in the garden, or
about the plants, to which Oliver—who had
studied this science also under the same master,
who was a gardener by trade—applied himself
with hearty goodwill till Miss Rose made her
appearance, when there were a thousand commendations
to be bestowed upon all he had
done, for which one of those light-hearted, beautiful
smiles was an ample recompence.</p>

<p>So three months glided away; three months
which, in the life of the most blessed and
favoured of mortals, would have been unmixed
happiness; but which, in Oliver’s troubled and
clouded dawn, were felicity indeed. With the
purest and most amiable generosity on one
side, and the truest, and warmest, and most
soul-felt gratitude on the other, it is no wonder
that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist
had become completely domesticated with the
old lady and her niece; and that the fervent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
attachment of his young and sensitive heart was
repaid by their pride in, and attachment to,
himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS
EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> flew swiftly by, and summer came;
and if the village had been beautiful at first, it
was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
richness. The great trees, which had looked
shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had
now burst into strong life and health, and
stretching forth their green arms over the
thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots
into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant
shade from which to look upon the wide
prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay
stretched out beyond. The earth had donned
her mantle of brightest green, and shed her
richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and
vigour of the year, and all things were glad and
flourishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Still the same quiet life went on at the little
cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed
among its inmates. Oliver had long
since grown stout and healthy; but health or
sickness made no difference in his warm feelings
to those about him, (though they do in the
feelings of a great many people,) and he was
still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature
that he had been when pain and suffering
had wasted his strength, and he was dependent
for every slight attention and comfort on those
who tended him.</p>

<p>One beautiful night they had taken a longer
walk than was customary with them, for the
day had been unusually warm, and there was a
brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up,
which was unusually refreshing. Rose had
been in high spirits, too, and they had walked
on, in merry conversation, until they had far
exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs. Maylie
was fatigued, and they returned more slowly
home. The young lady, merely throwing off
her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano, as
usual; after running abstractedly over the keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very
solemn air; and as she played it, they heard
her sob as if she were weeping.</p>

<p>“Rose, my dear?” said the elder lady.</p>

<p>Rose made no reply, but played a little
quicker, as though the sound had roused her
from some painful thoughts.</p>

<p>“Rose, my love!” cried Mrs. Maylie, rising
hastily, and bending over her. “What is this?
Your face is bathed in tears. My dear child,
what distresses you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, aunt,—nothing,” replied the
young lady. “I don’t know what it is; I
can’t describe it; but I feel so low to-night,
and——”</p>

<p>“Not ill, my love?” interposed Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>“No, no! Oh, not ill!” replied Rose, shuddering,
as though some deadly chillness were
passing over her while she spoke; “at least, I
shall be better presently. Close the window,
pray.”</p>

<p>Oliver hastened to comply with the request;
and the young lady, making an effort to recover
her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tune; but her fingers dropped powerless on the
keys, and covering her face with her hands, she
sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears
which she was now unable to repress.</p>

<p>“My child!” said the elder lady, folding her
arms about her, “I never saw you thus before.”</p>

<p>“I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,”
rejoined Rose; “but indeed I have tried very
hard, and cannot help this. I fear I <i>am</i> ill,
aunt.”</p>

<p>She was, indeed; for, when candles were
brought, they saw that in the very short time
which had elapsed since their return home, the
hue of her countenance had changed to a marble
whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing
of its beauty, but yet it was changed, and there
was an anxious, haggard look about that gentle
face which it had never worn before. Another
minute, and it was suffused with a crimson
flush, and a heavy wildness came over the soft
blue eye; again this disappeared, like the shadow
thrown by a passing cloud, and she was once
more deadly pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously,
observed that she was alarmed by these appearances,
and so, in truth, was he; but seeing that
she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured
to do the same; and they so far succeeded,
that when Rose was persuaded by her
aunt to retire for the night, she was in better
spirits, and appeared even in better health, and
assured them that she felt certain she should
wake in the morning quite well.</p>

<p>“I hope, ma’am,” said Oliver, when Mrs.
Maylie returned, “that nothing serious is the
matter? Miss Maylie doesn’t look well to-night,
but——”</p>

<p>The old lady motioned him not to speak, and
sitting herself down in a dark corner of the
room, remained silent for some time. At length,
she said, in a trembling voice,—</p>

<p>“I hope not, Oliver. I have been very
happy with her for some years—too happy,
perhaps, and it may be time that I should
meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is
not this.”</p>

<p>“What misfortune, ma’am?” inquired Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“The heavy blow,” said the old lady, almost
inarticulately, “of losing the dear girl who has
so long been my comfort and happiness.”</p>

<p>“Oh! God forbid!” exclaimed Oliver, hastily.</p>

<p>“Amen to that, my child!” said the old lady,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>“Surely there is no danger of anything so
dreadful!” said Oliver. “Two hours ago she
was quite well.”</p>

<p>“She is very ill now,” rejoined Mrs. Maylie,
“and will be worse, I am sure. My dear, dear
Rose! Oh, what should I do without her!”</p>

<p>The lady sank beneath her desponding
thoughts, and gave way to such great grief that
Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured
to remonstrate with her, and to beg earnestly
that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself,
she would be more calm.</p>

<p>“And consider, ma’am,” said Oliver, as the
tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite his
efforts to the contrary, “Oh! consider how
young and good she is, and what pleasure and
comfort she gives to all about her. I am sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>—certain—quite
certain—that, for your sake,
who are so good yourself, and for her own, and
for the sake of all she makes so happy, she will
not die. God will never let her die yet.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand
on Oliver’s head. “You think like a child,
poor boy; and although what you say may be
natural, it is wrong. But you teach me my
duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for
a moment, Oliver, and I hope I may be pardoned,
for I am old, and have seen enough of
illness and death to know the pain they leave
to those behind. I have seen enough, too, to
know that it is not always the youngest and
best who are spared to those that love them;
but this should give us comfort rather than sorrow,
for Heaven is just, and such things teach
us impressively that there is a far brighter
world than this, and that the passage to it is
speedy. God’s will be done! but I love her,
and He alone knows how well!”</p>

<p>Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs.
Maylie said these words, she checked her
lamentations as though by one struggle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
drawing herself up as she spoke, became quite
composed and firm. He was still more astonished
to find that this firmness lasted, and
that, under all the care and watching which
ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected,
performing all the duties which devolved
upon her steadily, and, to all external appearance,
even cheerfully. But he was young, and
did not know what strong minds are capable of
under trying circumstances. How should he,
indeed, when their possessors so seldom know
themselves?</p>

<p>An anxious night ensued, and when morning
came, Mrs. Maylie’s predictions were but too
well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a
high and dangerous fever.</p>

<p>“We must be active, Oliver, and not give
way to useless grief,” said Mrs. Maylie, laying
her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into
his face; “this letter must be sent, with all possible
expedition, to Mr. Losberne. It must be
carried to the market-town, which is not more
than four miles off, by the footpath across the
fields, and thence dispatched by an express on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
horseback straight to Chertsey. The people at
the inn will undertake to do this, and I can
trust you to see it done, I know.”</p>

<p>Oliver could make no reply, but looked his
anxiety to be gone at once.</p>

<p>“Here is another letter,” said Mrs. Maylie,
pausing to reflect; “but whether to send it
now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I
scarcely know. I would not forward it unless
I feared the worst.”</p>

<p>“Is it for Chertsey, too, ma’am?” inquired
Oliver, impatient to execute his commission,
and holding out his trembling hand for the
letter.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the old lady, giving it him
mechanically. Oliver glanced at it, and saw
that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,
at some lord’s house in the country; where, he
could not make out.</p>

<p>“Shall it go, ma’am?” asked Oliver, looking
up impatiently.</p>

<p>“I think not,” replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it
back. “I will wait till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>With these words she gave Oliver her purse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and he started off without more delay at the
greatest speed he could muster.</p>

<p>Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the
little lanes which sometimes divided them, now
almost hidden by the high corn on either side,
and now emerging into an open field, where
the mowers and haymakers were busy at their
work; nor did he stop once, save now and
then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until
he emerged, in a great heat, and covered with
dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.</p>

<p>Here he paused, and looked about for the
inn. There was a white bank, and a red
brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one
corner a large house, with all the wood about it
painted green, before which was the sign of
“The George,” to which he hastened directly
it caught his eye.</p>

<p>Oliver spoke to a postboy who was dozing
under the gateway, and who, after hearing what
he wanted, referred him to the hostler; who,
after hearing all he had to say again, referred
him to the landlord, who was a tall gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches,
and boots with tops to match, and was leaning
against a pump by the stable-door, picking his
teeth with a silver toothpick.</p>

<p>This gentleman walked with much deliberation
to the bar to make out the bill, which took
a long time making out, and after it was ready,
and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man
to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes
more; meanwhile, Oliver was in such a desperate
state of impatience and anxiety, that he
felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse
himself, and galloped away full tear to the next
stage. At length, all was ready, and the little
parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions
and entreaties for its speedy delivery,
the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling
over the uneven paving of the market-place, was
out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road,
in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>It was something to feel certain that assistance
was sent for, and that no time had been
lost. Oliver hurried up the inn-yard with a
somewhat lighter heart, and was turning out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the gateway when he accidentally stumbled
against a tall man, wrapped in a cloak, who
was that moment coming out at the inn-door.</p>

<p>“Hah!” cried the man, fixing his eyes on
Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. “What the
devil’s this?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver; “I
was in a great hurry to get home, and didn’t
see you were coming.”</p>

<p>“Death!” muttered the man to himself,
glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes.
“Who’d have thought it! Grind him to ashes!
He’d start up from a marble coffin to come in
my way!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sir,” stammered Oliver, confused
by the strange man’s wild look. “I hope
I have not hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Rot his bones!” murmured the man, in a
horrible passion, between his clenched teeth;
“if I had only had the courage to say the word, I
might have been free of him in a night. Curses
light upon your head, and black death upon
your heart, you imp! What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The man shook his fist, and gnashed his
teeth, as he uttered these words incoherently;
and advancing towards Oliver, as if with the
intention of aiming a blow at him, fell violently
on the ground, writhing and foaming, in
a fit.</p>

<p>Oliver gazed for a moment at the fearful
struggles of the madman (for such he supposed
him to be), and then darted into the house for
help. Having seen him safely carried into the
hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as
fast as he could, to make up for lost time, and
recalling, with a great deal of astonishment
and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of
the person from whom he had just parted.</p>

<p>The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection
long, however; for when he reached
the cottage, there was enough to occupy his
mind, and to drive all considerations of self
completely from his memory.</p>

<p>Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse, and
before midnight was delirious. A medical
practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in
constant attendance upon her, and after first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie
aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of
a most alarming nature. “In fact,” he said,
“it would be little short of a miracle if she
recovered.”</p>

<p>How often did Oliver start from his bed that
night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep,
to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound
from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble
shake his frame, and cold drops of terror
start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling
of feet caused him to fear that something too
dreadful to think of had even then occurred.
And what had been the fervency of all the
prayers he had ever uttered, compared with
those he poured forth now, in the agony and
passion of his supplication, for the life and
health of the gentle creature who was tottering
on the deep grave’s verge!</p>

<p>The suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of
standing idly by while the life of one we dearly
love is trembling in the balance—the racking
thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make
the heart beat violently, and the breath come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
thick, by the force of the images they conjure
up before it—the desperate anxiety <i>to be doing
something</i> to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger,
which we have no power to alleviate; and
the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad
remembrance of our helplessness produces,—what
tortures can equal these, and what reflections
or efforts can, in the full tide and fever of
the time, allay them!</p>

<p>Morning came, and the little cottage was
lonely and still. People spoke in whispers;
anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to
time, and women and children went away in
tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after
it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and
down the garden, raising his eyes every instant
to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the
darkened window looking as if death lay
stretched inside. Late at night, Mr. Losberne
arrived. “It is hard,” said the good doctor,
turning away as he spoke; “so young—so
much beloved—but there is very little hope.”</p>

<p>Another morning, the sun shone brightly,—as
brightly as if it looked upon no misery or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
care; and, with every leaf and flower in full
bloom about her,—with life, and health, and
sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on
every side, the fair young creature lay wasting
fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard,
and sitting down on one of the green mounds,
wept for her in silence.</p>

<p>There was such peace and beauty in the scene,
so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny
landscape, such blithesome music in the songs of
the summer birds, such freedom in the rapid
flight of the rook, careering overhead, so much
of life and joyousness in all, that when the boy
raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the
thought instinctively occurred to him, that this
was not a time for death; that Rose could
surely never die when humbler things were all
so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and
cheerless winter, not for sunlight and fragrance.
He almost thought that shrouds were for the
old and shrunken, and never wrapped the young
and graceful form within their ghastly folds.</p>

<p>A knell from the church bell broke harshly
on these youthful thoughts. Another—again!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
It was tolling for the funeral service. A group
of humble mourners entered the gate, and they
wore white favours, for the corpse was young.
They stood uncovered by a grave; and there
was a mother—a mother once—among the
weeping train. But the sun shone brightly,
and the birds sang on.</p>

<p>Oliver turned homewards, thinking on the
many kindnesses he had received from the
young lady, and wishing that the time could
come over again, that he might never cease
shewing her how grateful and attached he was.
He had no cause for self-reproach on the score
of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been
devoted to her service; and yet a hundred
little occasions rose up before him on which he
fancied he might have been more zealous and
more earnest, and wished he had been. We
need be careful how we deal with those about
us, for every death carries with it to some small
circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted,
and so little done—of so many things forgotten,
and so many more which might have been repaired,
that such recollections are among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
bitterest we can have. There is no remorse so
deep as that which is unavailing; if we would
be spared its tortures, let us remember this in
time.</p>

<p>When he reached home, Mrs. Maylie was sitting
in the little parlour. Oliver’s heart sank
at sight of her, for she had never left the bedside
of her niece, and he trembled to think what
change could have driven her away. He learnt
that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which
she would waken either to recovery and life,
or to bid them farewell, and die.</p>

<p>They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for
hours. The untasted meal was removed; and
with looks which shewed that their thoughts
were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he
sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over
sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald
his departure. Their quick ears caught the
sound of an approaching footstep, and they both
involuntarily darted towards the door, as Mr.
Losberne entered.</p>

<p>“What of Rose?” cried the old lady. “Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense!
Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!”</p>

<p>“You must compose yourself,” said the doctor,
supporting her. “Be calm, my dear ma’am,
pray.”</p>

<p>“Let me go, in God’s name!” gasped Mrs.
Maylie. “My dear child! She is dead! She is
dying!”</p>

<p>“No!” cried the doctor, passionately. “As
He is good and merciful, she will live to bless
us all for years to come.”</p>

<p>The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to
fold her hands together; but the energy which
had supported her so long fled to Heaven with
her first thanksgiving, and she sank back into
the friendly arms which were extended to receive
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE
TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON
THE SCENE, AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED
TO OLIVER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost too much happiness to bear.
Oliver felt stunned and stupified by the unexpected
intelligence; he could not weep, or
speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of
understanding anything that had passed, until,
after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a
burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed
to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful
change that had occurred, and the almost
insupportable load of anguish which had been
taken from his breast.</p>

<p>The night was fast closing in when he returned
homewards, laden with flowers which he
had culled with peculiar care for the adornment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of the sick chamber. As he walked
briskly along the road, he heard behind him the
noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious
pace. Looking round, he saw that it was a
post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the
horses were galloping, and the road was narrow,
he stood leaning against a gate until it
should have passed him by.</p>

<p>As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of
a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed
familiar to him, although his view was so brief
that he could not identify the person. In
another second or two, the nightcap was thrust
out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian
voice bellowed to the driver to stop, which he
did as soon as he could pull up his horses, when
the nightcap once again appeared, and the same
voice called Oliver by his name.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried the voice. “Master Oliver,
what’s the news? Miss Rose—Master O-li-ver.”</p>

<p>“Is it you, Giles?” cried Oliver, running up
to the chaise-door.</p>

<p>Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to making some reply, when he was suddenly
pulled back by a young gentleman who
occupied the other corner of the chaise, and
who eagerly demanded what was the news.</p>

<p>“In a word,” cried the gentleman, “better
or worse?”</p>

<p>“Better—much better!” replied Oliver,
hastily.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed the gentleman.
“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite, sir,” replied Oliver; “the change
took place only a few hours ago, and Mr. Losberne
says, that all danger is at an end.”</p>

<p>The gentleman said not another word, but,
opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking
Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.</p>

<p>“This is quite certain?—there is no possibility
of any mistake on your part, my boy, is
there?” demanded the gentleman, in a tremulous
voice. “Pray do not deceive me by awakening
any hopes that are not to be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“I would not for the world, sir,” replied
Oliver. “Indeed you may believe me. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Losberne’s words were, that she would live to
bless us all for many years to come. I heard
him say so.”</p>

<p>The tears stood in Oliver’s eyes as he recalled
the scene which was the beginning of so much
happiness, and the gentleman turned his face
away, and remained silent for some minutes.
Oliver thought he heard him sob more than
once, but he feared to interrupt him by any further
remark—for he could well guess what his
feelings were—and so stood apart, feigning to
be occupied with his nosegay.</p>

<p>All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap
on, had been sitting upon the steps of the
chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee,
and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief
dotted with white spots. That
the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion
was abundantly demonstrated by the very red
eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman,
when he turned round and addressed
him.</p>

<p>“I think you had better go on to my mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in the chaise, Giles,” said he. “I would rather
walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before
I see her. You can say I am coming.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,” said Giles,
giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance
with the handkerchief; “but if you would leave
the postboy to say that, I should be very much
obliged to you. It wouldn’t be proper for the
maids to see me in this state, sir; I should
never have any more authority with them if
they did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling,
“you can do as you like. Let him go on with
the portmanteaus, if you wish it, and do you
follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap
for some more appropriate covering, or we
shall be taken for madmen.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume,
snatched off and pocketed his nightcap,
and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape,
which he took out of the chaise. This done,
the postboy drove off, and Giles, Mr. Maylie,
and Oliver, followed at their leisure.</p>

<p>As they walked along, Oliver glanced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
time to time with much interest and curiosity
at the new-comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty
years of age, and was of the middle
height; his countenance was frank and handsome,
and his demeanour singularly easy and
prepossessing. Notwithstanding the differences
between youth and age, he bore so strong a
likeness to the old lady that Oliver would have
had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship,
even if he had not already spoken of
her as his mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive
her son when he reached the cottage, and the
meeting did not take place without great emotion
on both sides.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” whispered the young man,
“why did you not write before?”</p>

<p>“I did write,” replied Mrs. Maylie; “but,
on reflection, I determined to keep back the
letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne’s opinion.”</p>

<p>“But why,” said the young man, “why run
the chance of that occurring which so nearly
happened? If Rose had—I cannot utter that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
word now—if this illness had terminated differently,
how could you ever have forgiven yourself,
or I been happy again?”</p>

<p>“If that <i>had</i> been the case, Harry,” said Mrs.
Maylie, “I fear your happiness would have been
effectually blighted, and that your arrival here a
day sooner or later would have been of very,
very little import.”</p>

<p>“And who can wonder if it be so, mother?”
rejoined the young man; “or why should I
say, <i>if</i>?—It is—it is—you know it, mother—you
must know it!”</p>

<p>“I know that she well deserves the best and
purest love that the heart of man can offer,”
said Mrs. Maylie; “I know that the devotion
and affection of her nature require no ordinary
return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.
If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a
changed behaviour in one she loved would break
her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult
of performance, or have to encounter so many
struggles in my own bosom, when I take what
seems to me to be the strict line of duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is unkind, mother,” said Harry.
“Do you still suppose that I am so much a boy
as not to know my own mind, or to mistake the
impulses of my own soul?”</p>

<p>“I think, my dear fellow,” returned Mrs.
Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder,
“that youth has many generous impulses which
do not last; and that among them are some
which, being gratified, become only the more
fleeting. Above all, I think,” said the lady,
fixing her eyes on her son’s face, “that if an
enthusiastic, ardent, ambitious young man has
a wife on whose name is a stain, which, though
it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited
by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon
his children also, and, in exact proportion to his
success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and
made the subject of sneers against him, he may—no
matter how generous and good his nature—one
day repent of the connexion he formed
in early life, and she may have the pain and
torture of knowing that he does so.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said the young man, impatiently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
“he would be a mere selfish brute, unworthy
alike of the name of man and of the woman you
describe, who acted thus.”</p>

<p>“You think so now, Harry,” replied his
mother.</p>

<p>“And ever will!” said the young man. “The
mental agony I have suffered during the last
two days wrings from me the undisguised
avowal to you of a passion which, as you well
know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have
lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl!
my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man
was set on woman. I have no thought, or view,
or hope, in life beyond her; and if you oppose
me in this great stake, you take my peace and
happiness in your hands, and cast them to the
wind. Mother, think better of this, and of me,
and do not disregard the warm feelings of which
you seem to think so little.”</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “it is because I
think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that
I would spare them from being wounded. But
we have said enough, and more than enough,
on this matter just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let it rest with Rose, then,” interposed
Harry. “You will not press these overstrained
opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle
in my way?”</p>

<p>“I will not,” rejoined Mrs. Maylie; “but I
would have you consider——”</p>

<p>“I <i>have</i> considered!” was the impatient reply,—“I
have considered for years—considered
almost since I have been capable of serious reflection.
My feelings remain unchanged, as
they ever will; and why should I suffer the
pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can
be productive of no earthly good? No! Before
I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.”</p>

<p>“She shall,” said Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p>“There is something in your manner which
would almost imply that she will hear me
coldly, mother,” said the young man, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not coldly,” rejoined the old lady; “far
from it.”</p>

<p>“How then?” urged the young man. “She
has formed no other attachment?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” replied his mother; “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her
affections already.”</p>

<p>“What I would say,” resumed the old lady,
stopping her son as he was about to speak, “is
this: Before you stake your all on this chance,—before
you suffer yourself to be carried to the
highest point of hope, reflect for a few moments,
my dear child, on Rose’s history, and consider
what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth
may have on her decision,—devoted as she is
to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind,
and that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all
matters, great or trifling, has always been her
characteristic.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That I leave to you to discover,” replied
Mrs. Maylie. “I must go back to Rose. God
bless you!”</p>

<p>“I shall see you again to-night?” said the
young man, eagerly.</p>

<p>“By and by,” replied the lady; “when I
leave Rose.”</p>

<p>“You will tell her I am here?” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Mrs. Maylie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“And say how anxious I have been, and how
much I have suffered, and how I long to see
her—you will not refuse to do this, mother?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the old lady; “I will tell her
that,” and pressing her son’s hand affectionately,
she hastened from the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at
another end of the apartment while this hurried
conversation was proceeding. The former
now held out his hand to Harry Maylie, and
hearty salutations were exchanged between
them. The doctor then communicated, in
reply to multifarious questions from his young
friend, a precise account of his patient’s situation,
which was quite as consolatory and full of
promise as Oliver’s statement had encouraged
him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr.
Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage,
listened with greedy ears.</p>

<p>“Have you shot anything particular lately,
Giles?” inquired the doctor, when he had concluded.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular, sir,” replied Mr. Giles,
colouring up to the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying
any housebreakers?” said the doctor, maliciously.</p>

<p>“None at all, sir,” replied Mr. Giles, with
much gravity.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the doctor, “I am sorry to
hear it, because you do that sort of thing so
well. Pray, how is Brittles?”</p>

<p>“The boy is very well, sir,” said Mr. Giles,
recovering his usual tone of patronage; “and
sends his respectful duty, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s well,” said the doctor. “Seeing
you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the
day before that on which I was called away so
hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your
good mistress, a small commission in your
favour. Just step into this corner a moment,
will you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much
importance, and some wonder, and was honoured
with a short whispering conference with
the doctor; on the termination of which, he
made a great many bows, and retired with steps
of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
this conference was not disclosed in the parlour,
but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning
it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither,
and having called for a mug of ale, announced,
with an air of majestic majesty, which
was highly effective, that it had pleased his
mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour
on the occasion of that attempted robbery,
to deposit in the local savings-bank the sum of
twenty-five pounds for his sole use and benefit.
At this, the two women-servants lifted up their
hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles
would begin to be quite proud now; whereunto
Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied,
“No, no,”—and that if they observed that he
was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would
thank them to tell him so. And then he made
a great many other remarks, no less illustrative
of his humility, which were received with equal
favour and applause, and were withal as original,
and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of
great men commonly are.</p>

<p>Above stairs, the remainder of the evening
passed cheerfully away, for the doctor was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
high spirits, and however fatigued or thoughtful
Harry Maylie might have been at first, he
was not proof against the worthy gentleman’s
good humour, which displayed itself in a great
variety of sallies and professional recollections,
and an abundance of small jokes, which struck
Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever
heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately,
to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who
laughed immoderately at himself, and made
Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force
of sympathy. So they were as pleasant a party
as, under the circumstances, they could well have
been, and it was late before they retired, with
light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of
which, after the doubt and suspense they had
recently undergone, they stood so much in
need.</p>

<p>Oliver rose next morning in better heart, and
went about his usual early occupations with
more hope and pleasure than he had known for
many days. The birds were once more hung
out to sing in their old places, and the sweetest
wild flowers that could be found were once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
more gathered to gladden Rose with their
beauty and fragrance. The melancholy which
had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy
to hang for days past over every object, beautiful
as they all were, was dispelled by magic.
The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on
the green leaves, the air to rustle among them
with a sweeter music, and the sky itself to look
more blue and bright. Such is the influence
which the condition of our own thoughts exercises
even over the appearance of external objects.
Men who look on nature and their fellow-men,
and cry that all is dark and gloomy,
are in the right; but the sombre colours are
reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and
hearts. The real hues are delicate, and require
a clearer vision.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail
to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions
were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,
after the very first morning when he met
Oliver coming laden home, was seized with
such a passion for flowers, and displayed such
a taste in their arrangement, as left his young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
companion far behind. If Oliver were behind-hand
in these respects, however, he knew where
the best were to be found, and morning after
morning they scoured the country together,
and brought home the fairest that blossomed.
The window of the young lady’s chamber was
opened now, for she loved to feel the rich summer
air stream in and revive her with its freshness;
but there always stood in water, just
inside the lattice, one particular little bunch
which was made up with great care every
morning. Oliver could not help noticing that
the withered flowers were never thrown away,
although the little vase was regularly replenished;
nor could he help observing, that whenever
the doctor came into the garden he invariably
cast his eyes up to that particular corner,
and nodded his head most expressively, as he
set forth on his morning’s walk. Pending
these observations, the days were flying by,
and Rose was rapidly and surely recovering.</p>

<p>Nor did Oliver’s time hang heavy upon his
hands, although the young lady had not yet left
her chamber, and there were no evening walks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
save now and then for a short distance with
Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself with redoubled
assiduity to the instructions of the white-headed
old gentleman, and laboured so hard
that his quick progress surprised even himself.
It was while he was engaged in this pursuit
that he was greatly startled and distressed by
a most unexpected occurrence.</p>

<p>The little room in which he was accustomed
to sit, when busy at his books, was on the
ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was
quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window,
around which were clusters of jessamine and
honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and
filled the place with their delicious perfume.
It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate
opened into a small paddock; all beyond was
fine meadow-land and wood. There was no
other dwelling near in that direction, and the
prospect it commanded was very extensive.</p>

<p>One beautiful evening, when the first shades
of twilight were beginning to settle upon the
earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon
his books. He had been poring over them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
some time; and as the day had been uncommonly
sultry, and he had exerted himself a great
deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever
they may have been, to say, that gradually
and by slow degrees he fell asleep.</p>

<p>There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us
sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner,
does not free the mind from a sense of
things about it, and enable it to ramble as it
pleases. So far as an overpowering heaviness,
a prostration of strength, and an utter inability
to control our thoughts or power of motion, can
be called sleep, this is it; and yet we have a
consciousness of all that is going on about us,
and even if we dream, words which are really
spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment,
accommodate themselves with surprising
readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination
become so strangely blended that it is
afterwards almost a matter of impossibility to
separate the two. Nor is this the most striking
phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is
an ascertained fact, that although our senses of
touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that
pass before us, will be influenced, and materially
influenced, by the <i>mere silent presence</i> of some
external object, which may not have been near
us when we closed our eyes, and of whose
vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.</p>

<p>Oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his
own little room, that his books were lying on
the table before him, and that the sweet air was
stirring among the creeping plants outside,—and
yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene
changed, the air became close and confined, and
he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in
the Jew’s house again. There sat the hideous
old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at
him, and whispering to another man with his
face averted who sat beside him.</p>

<p>“Hush, my dear!” he thought he heard the
Jew say; “it is him, sure enough. Come
away.”</p>

<p>“He!” the other man seemed to answer;
“could I mistake him, think you? If a crowd
of devils were to put themselves into his exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
shape, and he stood amongst them, there is
something that would tell me how to point him
out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and
took me across his grave, I should know, if
there wasn’t a mark above it, that he lay buried
there. Wither his flesh, I should!”</p>

<p>The man seemed to say this with such dreadful
hatred that Oliver awoke with the fear, and
started up.</p>

<p>Good God! what was that which sent the
blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of
voice, or power to move! There—there—at the
window—close before him—so close, that he
could have almost touched him before he
started back—with his eyes peering into the
room, and meeting his—there stood the Jew!
and beside him, white with rage, or fear, or
both, were the scowling features of the very
man who had accosted him at the inn-yard.</p>

<p>It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before
his eyes, and they were gone. But they had
recognised him, and he them; and their look
was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before
him from his birth. He stood transfixed
for a moment, and then, leaping from the window
into the garden, called loudly for help.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class='chaptertitle'>CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER’S
ADVENTURE, AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE
BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the inmates of the house, attracted
by Oliver’s cries, hurried to the spot from
which they proceeded, they found him, pale
and agitated, pointing in the direction of the
meadows behind the house, and scarcely able
to articulate the words, “The Jew! the Jew!”</p>

<p>Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what
this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose
perceptions were something quicker, and who
had heard Oliver’s history from his mother,
understood it at once.</p>

<p>“What direction did he take?” he asked,
catching up a heavy stick which was standing
in a corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“That,” replied Oliver, pointing out the
course the men had taken; “I missed them
all in an instant.”</p>

<p>“Then they are in the ditch!” said Harry.
“Follow, and keep as near me as you can.” So
saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off
with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding
difficulty for the others to keep near
him.</p>

<p>Giles followed as well as he could, and Oliver
followed too; and in the course of a minute or
two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking,
and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge
after them, and picking himself up with more
agility than he could have been supposed to
possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible
speed, shouting all the while most
prodigiously to know what was the matter.</p>

<p>On they all went; nor stopped they once to
breathe, until the leader, striking off into an
angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to
search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining;
which afforded time for the remainder of the
party to come up, and for Oliver to communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that
had led to so vigorous a pursuit.</p>

<p>The search was all in vain. There were not
even the traces of recent footsteps to be seen.
They stood now on the summit of a little hill,
commanding the open fields in every direction
for three or four miles. There was the village
in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain
that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed
out, the men must have made a circuit of open
ground, which it was impossible they could have
accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood
skirted the meadow-land in another direction;
but they could not have gained that covert for
the same reason.</p>

<p>“It must have been a dream, Oliver?” said
Harry Maylie, taking him aside.</p>

<p>“Oh no, indeed, sir,” replied Oliver, shuddering
at the very recollection of the old wretch’s
countenance; “I saw him too plainly for that.
I saw them both as plainly as I see you now.”</p>

<p>“Who was the other?” inquired Harry and
Mr. Losberne, together.</p>

<p>“The very same man that I told you of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,”
said Oliver. “We had our eyes fixed full upon
each other, and I could swear to him.”</p>

<p>“They took this way?” demanded Harry;
“are you certain of that?”</p>

<p>“As I am that the men were at the window,”
replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to
the hedge which divided the cottage-garden
from the meadow. “The tall man leaped over
just there; and the Jew, running a few paces
to the right, crept through that gap.”</p>

<p>The two gentlemen watched Oliver’s earnest
face as he spoke, and looking from him to each
other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy
of what he said. Still, in no direction were
there any appearances of the trampling of men
in hurried flight. The grass was long, but it
was trodden down nowhere, save where their
own feet had crushed it. The sides and brinks
of the ditches were of damp clay, but in no one
place could they discern the print of men’s
shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate
that any feet had pressed the ground for
hours before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is strange!” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Strange!” echoed the doctor. “Blathers
and Duff themselves could make nothing
of it.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the evidently inefficacious
nature of their search, however, they did not
desist until the coming on of night rendered
its farther prosecution hopeless, and even then
they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was dispatched
to the different alehouses in the village,
furnished with the best description Oliver
could give of the appearance and dress of the
strangers; of whom the Jew was, at all events,
sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing
he had been seen drinking, or loitering
about; but he returned without any intelligence
calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.</p>

<p>On the next day, further search was made,
and the inquiries renewed, but with no better
success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr.
Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope
of seeing or hearing something of the men
there; but this effort was equally fruitless; and
after a few days, the affair began to be forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as most affairs are, when wonder, having no
fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She
had left her room, was able to go out, and mixing
once more with the family, carried joy into
the hearts of all.</p>

<p>But although this happy change had a visible
effect on the little circle, and although cheerful
voices and merry laughter were once more
heard in the cottage, there was, at times, an unwonted
restraint upon some there—even upon
Rose herself—which Oliver could not fail to remark.
Mrs. Maylie and her son were often
closeted together for a long time, and more than
once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon
her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day
for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms
increased, and it became evident that something
was in progress which affected the peace
of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.</p>

<p>At length, one morning, when Rose was alone
in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and, with some hesitation, begged permission to
speak with her for a few moments.</p>

<p>“A few—a very few—will suffice, Rose,”
said the young man, drawing his chair towards
her. “What I shall have to say has already
presented itself to your mind; the most cherished
hopes of my heart are not unknown to
you, though from my lips you have not yet
heard them stated.”</p>

<p>Rose had been very pale from the moment
of his entrance, although that might have been
the effect of her recent illness. She merely
bowed, and bending over some plants that
stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.</p>

<p>“I—I—ought to have left here before,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>“You should, indeed,” replied Rose. “Forgive
me for saying so, but I wish you had.”</p>

<p>“I was brought here by the most dreadful
and agonizing of all apprehensions,” said the
young man; “the fear of losing the one dear
being on whom my every wish and hope are
centred. You had been dying—trembling between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
earth and heaven. We know that when
the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited
with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn
towards their bright home of lasting rest, and
hence it is, that the best and fairest of our kind
so often fade in blooming.”</p>

<p>There were tears in the eye of the gentle girl
as these words were spoken, and when one fell
upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened
brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful,
it seemed as though the outpourings of a
fresh young heart claimed common kindred
with the loveliest things in nature.</p>

<p>“An angel,” continued the young man, passionately,
“a creature as fair and innocent of
guile as one of God’s own angels, fluttered between
life and death. Oh! who could hope,
when the distant world to which she was akin
half opened to her view, that she would return
to the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose,
Rose, to know that you were passing away like
some soft shadow, which a light from above
casts upon the earth—to have no hope that you
would be spared to those who linger here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to know no reason why you should—to feel that
you belonged to that bright sphere whither so
many gifted creatures, in infancy and youth,
have winged their early flight—and yet to pray,
amid all these consolations, that you might be
restored to those who loved you—these are
distractions almost too great to bear. They
were mine by day and night, and with them
came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions,
and selfish regrets, lest you should die
and never know how devotedly I loved you, as
almost bore down sense and reason in its
course. You recovered—day by day, and
almost hour by hour, some drop of health came
back, and mingling with the spent and feeble
stream of life which circulated languidly within
you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide.
I have watched you change almost from death
to life, with eyes that moistened with their own
eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me
that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened
my heart to all mankind.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean that,” said Rose, weeping;
“I only wish you had left here, that you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
have turned to high and noble pursuits again—to
pursuits well worthy of you.”</p>

<p>“There is no pursuit more worthy of me—more
worthy of the highest nature that exists—than
the struggle to win such a heart as yours,”
said the young man, taking her hand. “Rose,
my own dear Rose, for years—for years, I have
loved you, hoping to win my way to fame, and
then come proudly home and tell you it had
been sought only for you to share; thinking in
my day-dreams how I would remind you in that
happy moment of the many silent tokens I had
given of a boy’s attachment, and rally you who
had blushed to mark them, and then claim your
hand, as if in redemption of some old mute contract
that had been sealed between us. That
time has not arrived; but here, with no fame
won, and no young vision realized, I give to
you the heart so long your own, and stake my
all upon the words with which you greet the
offer.”</p>

<p>“Your behaviour has ever been kind and
noble,” said Rose, mastering the emotions by
which she was agitated. “As you believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my
answer.”</p>

<p>“It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you—is
it, dear Rose?”</p>

<p>“It is,” replied Rose, “that you must endeavour
to forget me—not as your old and
dearly-attached companion, for that would
wound me deeply, but as the object of your
love. Look into the world, think how many
hearts you would be equally proud to gain are
there. Confide some other passion to me if
you will, and I will be the truest, warmest,
most faithful friend you have.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which, Rose, who
had covered her face with one hand, gave free
vent to her tears. Harry still retained the
other. “And your reasons, Rose,” he said, at
length, in a low voice; “your reasons for this
decision—may I ask them?”</p>

<p>“You have a right to know them,” rejoined
Rose. “You can say nothing to alter my resolution.
It is a duty that I must perform. I
owe it alike to others and to myself.”</p>

<p>“To yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Harry; I owe it to myself, that I, a
friendless, portionless girl, with a blight upon
my name, should not give the world reason to
suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first
passion, and fastened myself, a clog, upon all
your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and
yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the
warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle
to your progress in the world.”</p>

<p>“If your inclinations chime with your sense
of duty——” Harry began.</p>

<p>“They do not,” replied Rose, colouring
deeply.</p>

<p>“Then you return my love?” said Harry.
“Say but that, Rose; say but that, and soften
the bitterness of this hard disappointment!”</p>

<p>“If I could have done so without doing
heavy wrong to him I loved,” rejoined Rose,
“I could have——”</p>

<p>“Have received this declaration very differently?”
said Harry, with great eagerness. “Do
not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.”</p>

<p>“I could,” said Rose. “Stay,” she added,
disengaging her hand, “why should we prolong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
this painful interview? Most painful to me, and
yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding;
for it <i>will</i> be happiness to know that
I once held the high place in your regard which
I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve
in life will animate me with new fortitude and
firmness. Farewell, Harry! for as we have
met to-day, we meet no more: but in other relations
than those in which this conversation
would have placed us, may we be long and happily
intwined; and may every blessing that the
prayers of a true and earnest heart can call
down from where all is truth and sincerity,
cheer and prosper you!”</p>

<p>“Another word, Rose,” said Harry. “Your
reason in your own words. From your own
lips let me hear it.”</p>

<p>“The prospect before you,” answered Rose,
firmly, “is a brilliant one; all the honours to
which great talents and powerful connexions
can help men in public life are in store for you.
But those connexions are proud, and I will
neither mingle with such as hold in scorn the
mother who gave me life, nor bring disgrace or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
failure upon the son of her who has so well
supplied that mother’s place. In a word,”
said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary
firmness forsook her, “there is a stain
upon my name which the world visits on innocent
heads: I will carry it into no blood but
my own, and the reproach shall rest alone on
me.”</p>

<p>“One word more, Rose—dear Rose! one
more!” cried Harry, throwing himself before
her. “If I had been less, less fortunate, as
the world would call it,—if some obscure and
peaceful life had been my destiny,—if I had
been poor, sick, helpless,—would you have
turned from me then? or has my probable
advancement to riches and honour given this
scruple birth?”</p>

<p>“Do not press me to reply,” answered Rose,
“the question does not arise, and never will.
It is unfair, unkind, to urge it.”</p>

<p>“If your answer be what I almost dare to
hope it is,” retorted Harry, “it will shed a
gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and
light the dreary path before me. It is not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a
few brief words, for one who loves us beyond
all else. Oh, Rose! in the name of my ardent
and enduring attachment,—in the name of all I
have suffered for you, and all you doom me to
undergo,—answer me that one question!”</p>

<p>“Then, if your lot had been differently cast,”
rejoined Rose; “if you had been even a little,
but not so far, above me; if I could have been a
help and comfort to you in some humble scene
of peace and retirement, and not a blot and
drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds,
I should have been spared this trial. I have
every reason to be happy, very happy, now;
but then, Harry, I own I should have been
happier.”</p>

<p>Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as
a girl long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose,
while making this avowal; but they brought
tears with them, as old hopes will when they
come back withered, and they relieved her.</p>

<p>“I cannot help this weakness, and it makes
my purpose stronger,” said Rose, extending her
hand. “I must leave you now, indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ask one promise,” said Harry. “Once,
and only once more,—say within a year, but it
may be much sooner,—let me speak to you
again on this subject for the last time.”</p>

<p>“Not to press me to alter my right determination,”
replied Rose, with a melancholy smile;
“it will be useless.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harry; “to hear you repeat it,
if you will; finally repeat it. I will lay at your
feet whatever of station or fortune I may possess,
and if you still adhere to your present
resolution, will not seek by word or act to
change it.”</p>

<p>“Then let it be so,” rejoined Rose; “it is
but one pang the more, and by that time I may
be enabled to bear it better.”</p>

<p>She extended her hand again, but the young
man caught her to his bosom, and imprinting
one kiss upon her beautiful forehead, hurried
from the room.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> so you are resolved to be my travelling-companion
this morning—eh?” said the
doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver
at the breakfast-table. “Why, you are not in
the same mind or intention two half-hours
together.”</p>

<p>“You will tell me a different tale one of
these days,” said Harry, colouring without any
perceptible reason.</p>

<p>“I hope I may have good cause to do so,”
replied Mr. Losberne; “though I confess I
don’t think I shall. But yesterday morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you had made up your mind, in a great hurry
to stay here, and accompany your mother, like
a dutiful son, to the sea-side; before noon, you
announce that you are going to do me the
honour of accompanying me as far as I go on
your road to London; and at night, you urge
me with great mystery to start before the ladies
are stirring; the consequence of which is, that
young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast
when he ought to be ranging the meadows
after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too
bad, isn’t it, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“I should have been very sorry not to have
been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went
away, sir,” rejoined Oliver.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine fellow,” said the doctor; “you
shall come and see me when you return. But,
to speak seriously, Harry, has any communication
from the great nobs produced this sudden
anxiety on your part to be gone?”</p>

<p>“The great nobs,” replied Harry, “under
which designation, I presume, you include my
most stately uncle, have not communicated
with me at all since I have been here, nor, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
this time of the year, is it likely that anything
would occur to render necessary my immediate
attendance among them.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the doctor, “you are a queer
fellow. But of course they will get you into
parliament at the election before Christmas,
and these sudden shiftings and changes are
no bad preparation for political life. There’s
something in that; good training is always desirable,
whether the race be for place, cup, or
sweepstakes.”</p>

<p>Harry Maylie looked as if he could have
followed up this short dialogue by one or two
remarks that would have staggered the doctor
not a little, but he contented himself with saying,
“We shall see,” and pursued the subject
no further. The post-chaise drove up to the
door shortly afterwards, and Giles coming in
for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out to
see it packed away.</p>

<p>“Oliver,” said Harry Maylie, in a low voice,
“let me speak a word with you.”</p>

<p>Oliver walked into the window-recess to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised
at the mixture of sadness and boisterous
spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.</p>

<p>“You can write well now,” said Harry, laying
his hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“I shall not be at home again, perhaps for
some time; I wish you would write to me—say
once a fortnight, every alternate Monday,
to the General Post Office in London: will
you?” said Mr. Maylie.</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do
it,” exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with
the commission.</p>

<p>“I should like to know how—how my mother
and Miss Maylie are,” said the young
man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me
what walks you take, and what you talk about,
and whether she—they, I mean, seem happy
and quite well. You understand me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! quite, sir, quite,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“I would rather you did not mention it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
them,” said Harry, hurrying over his words;
“because it might make my mother anxious to
write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry
to her. Let it be a secret between you and me,
and mind you tell me every thing; I depend
upon you.”</p>

<p>Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a
sense of his importance, faithfully promised
to be secret and explicit in his communications,
and Mr. Maylie took leave of him with
many warm assurances of his regard and protection.</p>

<p>The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it
had been arranged, should be left behind) held
the door open in his hand; and the women-servants
were in the garden looking on. Harry
cast one slight glance at the latticed window,
and jumped into the carriage.</p>

<p>“Drive on!” he cried, “hard, fast, full
gallop; nothing short of flying will keep pace
with me to-day.”</p>

<p>“Halloa!” cried the doctor, letting down
the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting
to the postilion, “something very short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of flying will keep pace with me. Do you
hear?”</p>

<p>Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered
its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress
only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound
its way along the road almost hidden in a
cloud of dust, now wholly disappearing, and
now becoming visible again, as intervening
objects or the intricacies of the way permitted.
It was not until even the dusty cloud
was no longer to be seen that the gazers
dispersed.</p>

<p>And there was one looker-on, who remained
with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage
had disappeared, long after it was many
miles away; for behind the white curtain which
had shrouded her from view when Harry
raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose
herself.</p>

<p>“He seems in high spirits and happy,”
she said, at length. “I feared for a time he
might be otherwise—I was mistaken. I am
very, very glad.”</p>

<p>Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
but those which coursed down Rose’s face,
as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing
in the same direction, seemed to tell more of
sorrow than of joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class='h2desc'>IN WHICH THE READER, IF HE OR SHE RESORT TO THE
FIFTH CHAPTER OF THIS SECOND BOOK, WILL PERCEIVE
A CONTRAST NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bumble</span> sat in the workhouse parlour,
with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless
grate, whence, as it was summer time, no
brighter gleam proceeded than the reflection of
certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent
back from its cold and shining surface. A paper
fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he
occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought;
and, as the heedless insects hovered round the
gaudy network, Mr. Bumble would heave a
deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread
his countenance. Mr. Bumble was
meditating, and it might be that the insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
brought to mind some painful passage in his
own past life.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr. Bumble’s gloom the only thing
calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in
the bosom of a spectator. There were not
wanting other appearances, and those closely
connected with his own person, which announced
that a great change had taken place in
the position of his affairs. The laced coat and
the cocked hat, where were they? He still
wore knee-breeches and dark cotton stockings
on his nether limbs, but they were not <i>the</i>
breeches. The coat was wide-skirted, and in
that respect like <i>the</i> coat, but, oh, how different!
The mighty cocked-hat was replaced by a modest
round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a
beadle.</p>

<p>There are some promotions in life which,
independent of the more substantial rewards
they offer, acquire peculiar value and dignity
from the coats and waistcoats connected with
them. A field-marshal has his uniform, a
bishop his silk apron, a counsellor his silk
gown, a beadle his cocked hat. Strip the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his cocked
hat and gold lace, what are they? Men,—mere
men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes,
are more questions of coat and waistcoat
than some people imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and
was master of the workhouse. Another beadle
had come into power, and on him the cocked-hat,
gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three
descended.</p>

<p>“And to-morrow two months it was done!”
said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. “It seems a age.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had
concentrated a whole existence of happiness
into the short space of eight weeks; but the
sigh—there was a vast deal of meaning in the
sigh.</p>

<p>“I sold myself,” said Mr. Bumble, pursuing
the same train of reflection, “for six tea-spoons,
a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot, with a
small quantity of second-hand furniter, and
twenty pound in money. I went very reasonable—cheap,
dirt cheap.”</p>

<p>“Cheap!” cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ear: “You would have been dear at any price;
and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above
knows that!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble turned and encountered the face
of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending
the few words she had overheard
of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing
remark at a venture.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bumble, ma’am!” said Mr. Bumble,
with sentimental sternness.</p>

<p>“Well?” cried the lady.</p>

<p>“Have the goodness to look at me,” said
Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her.</p>

<p>“If she stands such a eye as that,” said Mr.
Bumble to himself, “she can stand anything.
It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers,
and if it fails with her my power is gone.”</p>

<p>Whether an exceedingly small expansion of
eye is sufficient to quell paupers, who, being
lightly fed, are in no very high condition, or
whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly
proof against eagle glances, are matters of
opinion. The matter of fact is, that the matron
was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
scowl, but on the contrary, treated it with
great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat,
which sounded as though it were genuine.</p>

<p>On hearing this most unexpected sound,
Mr. Bumble looked first incredulous, and afterwards,
amazed. He then relapsed into his
former state; nor did he rouse himself until his
attention was again awakened by the voice of
his partner.</p>

<p>“Are you going to sit snoring there all
day?” inquired Mrs. Bumble.</p>

<p>“I am going to sit here as long as I think
proper, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble; “and
although I was <i>not</i> snoring, I shall snore, gape,
sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me,
such being my prerogative.”</p>

<p>“Your prerogative!” sneered Mrs. Bumble,
with ineffable contempt.</p>

<p>“I said the word, ma’am,” observed Mr.
Bumble. “The prerogative of a man is to
command.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the prerogative of a woman,
in the name of goodness?” cried the relict of
Mr. Corney, deceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“To obey, ma’am,” thundered Mr. Bumble.
“Your late unfort’nate husband should have
taught it you, and then, perhaps, he might
have been alive now. I wish he was, poor
man!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance that the decisive
moment had now arrived, and that a blow
struck for the mastership on one side or other
must necessarily be final and conclusive, no
sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone,
than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud
scream, that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted
brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.</p>

<p>But tears were not the things to find their
way to Mr. Bumble’s soul; his heart was waterproof.
Like washable beaver hats, that improve
with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and
more vigorous by showers of tears, which, being
tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions
of his own power, pleased and exalted him. He
eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction,
and begged, in an encouraging manner,
that she should cry her hardest, the exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
being looked upon by the faculty as strongly
conducive to health.</p>

<p>“It opens the lungs, washes the countenance,
exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,”
said Mr. Bumble; “so cry away.”</p>

<p>As he discharged himself of this pleasantry,
Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting
it on rather rakishly on one side, as a man
might do who felt he had asserted his superiority
in a becoming manner, thrust his hands
into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door
with much ease and waggishness depicted in his
whole appearance.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Corney that was had tried the
tears, because they were less troublesome than
a manual assault; but she was quite prepared to
make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as
Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.</p>

<p>The first proof he experienced of the fact was
conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded
by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
opposite end of the room. This preliminary
proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
clasping him tight round the throat with one
hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with
singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the
other. This done, she created a little variety
by scratching his face and tearing his hair off,
and having, by this time, inflicted as much
punishment as she deemed necessary for the
offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was
luckily well situated for the purpose, and defied
him to talk about his prerogative again if he
dared.</p>

<p>“Get up!” said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of
command, “and take yourself away from here,
unless you want me to do something desperate.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance,
wondering much what something desperate
might be, and, picking up his hat, looked
towards the door.</p>

<p>“Are you going?” demanded Mrs. Bumble.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” rejoined
Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards
the door. “I didn’t intend to—I’m going, my
dear—you are so very violent, that really I—”</p>

<p>At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
forward to replace the carpet, which had been
kicked up in the scuffle; and Mr. Bumble immediately
darted out of the room, without bestowing
another thought on his unfinished sentence,
leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession
of the field.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise,
and fairly beaten. He had a decided bullying
propensity, derived no inconsiderable pleasure
from the exercise of petty cruelty, and, consequently,
was (it is needless to say) a coward.
This is by no means a disparagement to his
character; for many official personages, who are
held in high respect and admiration, are the
victims of similar infirmities. The remark is
made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise,
and with the view of impressing the reader
with a just sense of his qualifications for office.</p>

<p>But the measure of his degradation was not
yet full. After making a tour of the house, and
thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws
really were too hard upon people, and that men
who ran away from their wives, leaving them
chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
visited with no punishment at all, but rather
rewarded as meritorious individuals who had
suffered much, Mr. Bumble came to a room
where some of the female paupers were usually
employed in washing the parish linen, and
whence the sound of voices in conversation now
proceeded.</p>

<p>“Hem!” said Mr. Bumble, summoning up
all his native dignity “These women at least
shall continue to respect the prorogative. Hallo!
hallo there!—what do you mean by this noise,
you hussies?”</p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the
door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry
manner, which was at once exchanged for a most
humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly
rested on the form of his lady wife.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mr. Bumble, “I didn’t
know you were here.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know I was here!” repeated Mrs.
Bumble. “What do <i>you</i> do here?”</p>

<p>“I thought they were talking rather too
much to be doing their work properly, my dear,”
replied Mr. Bumble, glancing distractedly at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
couple of old women at the washtub, who were
comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master’s
humility.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/i314.jpg" width="407" height="500" alt="Mrs. Bumble shouting at Mr. Bumble in front of the washerwomen" />
<div class="caption"><i>Mr. Bumble degraded in the eyes of the Paupers.</i></div>
</div>

<p>“You thought they were talking too much?”
said Mrs. Bumble. “What business is it of
yours?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear—” urged Mr. Bumble, submissively.</p>

<p>“What business is it of yours?” demanded
Mrs. Bumble, again.</p>

<p>“It’s very true, you’re matron here, my
dear,” submitted Mr. Bumble; “but I thought
you mightn’t be in the way just then.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,” returned
his lady, “we don’t want any of your interference,
and you’re a great deal too fond of
poking your nose into things that don’t concern
you, making everybody in the house laugh the
moment your back is turned, and making yourself
look like a fool every hour in the day. Be
off; come!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings
the delight of the two old paupers who
were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated
for an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose
patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl
of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the
door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain
of receiving the contents upon his portly person.</p>

<p>What could Mr. Bumble do? He looked
dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he
reached the door, the titterings of the paupers
broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight
It wanted but this. He was degraded
in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before
the very paupers; he had fallen from all
the height and pomp of beadleship to the lowest
depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.</p>

<p>“All in two months!” said Mr. Bumble,
filled with dismal thoughts. “Two months—not
more than two months ago, I was not only
my own master, but everybody else’s, so far as
the porochial workhouse was concerned, and
now!——”</p>

<p>It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the
ears of the boy who opened the gate for him
(for he had reached the portal in his reverie),
and walked distractedly into the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a><br /><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked up one street and down another,
until exercise had abated the first passion of his
grief, and then the revulsion of feeling made
him thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses,
and at length paused before one in a
by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a
hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save
by one solitary customer. It began to rain
heavily at the moment, and this determined
him; Mr. Bumble stepped in, and ordering
something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered
the apartment into which he had looked from
the street.</p>

<p>The man who was seated there was tall and
dark, and wore a large cloak. He had the air
of a stranger, and seemed, by a certain haggardness
in his look, as well as by the dusty soils
on his dress, to have travelled some distance.
He eyed Bumble askance as he entered, but
scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment
of his salutation.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for
two, supposing even that the stranger had been
more familiar, so he drank his gin-and-water in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
silence, and read the paper with great show of
pomp and importance.</p>

<p>It so happened, however—as it will happen
very often, when men fall into company under
such circumstances—that Mr. Bumble felt every
now and then a powerful inducement, which he
could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger;
and that whenever he did so he withdrew his
eyes in some confusion, to find that the stranger
was at that moment stealing a look at him.
Mr. Bumble’s awkwardness was enhanced by
the very remarkable expression of the stranger’s
eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed
by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything
he had ever observed before, and most
repulsive to behold.</p>

<p>When they had encountered each other’s
glance several times in this way, the stranger,
in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.</p>

<p>“Were you looking for me,” he said, “when
you peered in at the window?”</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of, unless you’re
Mr. ——” Here Mr. Bumble stopped short,
for he was curious to know the stranger’s name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and thought, in his impatience, he might supply
the blank.</p>

<p>“I see you were not,” said the stranger, an
expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his
mouth, “or you would have known my name.
You don’t know it, and I should recommend
you not to inquire.”</p>

<p>“I meant no harm, young man,” observed
Mr. Bumble, majestically.</p>

<p>“And have done none,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>Another silence succeeded this short dialogue,
which was again broken by the stranger.</p>

<p>“I have seen you before, I think,” said he.
“You were differently dressed at that time,
and I only passed you in the street, but I should
know you again. You were beadle here once,
were you not?”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise;
“porochial beadle.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” rejoined the other, nodding his
head. “It was in that character I saw you.
What are you now?”</p>

<p>“Master of the workhouse,” rejoined Mr.
Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise
assume. “Master of the workhouse, young
man!”</p>

<p>“You have the same eye to your own interest
that you always have had, I doubt not?” resumed
the stranger, looking keenly into Mr.
Bumble’s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment
at the question. “Don’t scruple to answer
freely, man. I know you pretty well, you
see.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, a married man,” replied Mr.
Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and
surveying the stranger from head to foot in
evident perplexity, “is not more averse to turning
an honest penny when he can than a single
one. Porochial officers are not so well paid
that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee,
when it comes to them in a civil and proper
manner.”</p>

<p>The stranger smiled, and nodded his head
again; as much as to say, he found he had not
mistaken his man: then rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Fill this glass again,” he said, handing Mr.
Bumble’s empty tumbler to the landlord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
“Let it be strong and hot. You like it so, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not too strong,” replied Mr. Bumble, with
a delicate cough.</p>

<p>“You understand what that means, landlord!”
said the stranger, drily.</p>

<p>The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly
afterwards returned with a steaming jorum, of
which the first gulp brought the water into
Mr. Bumble’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me,” said the stranger, after
closing the door and window. “I came down
to this place to-day to find you out, and, by
one of those chances which the devil throws in
the way of his friends sometimes, you walked
into the very room I was sitting in while you
were uppermost in my mind. I want some information
from you, and don’t ask you to give
it for nothing, slight as it is. Put up that to
begin with.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns
across the table to his companion carefully, as
though unwilling that the chinking of money
should be heard without; and when Mr. Bumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had scrupulously examined the coins, to see
that they were genuine, and put them up, with
much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he
went on,—</p>

<p>“Carry your memory back—let me see—twelve
years, last winter.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long time,” said Mr. Bumble. “Very
good. I’ve done it.”</p>

<p>“The scene, the workhouse.”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>“And the time, night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it
was, in which miserable drabs brought forth
the life and health so often denied to themselves—gave
birth to puling children for the parish
to rear, and hid their shame, rot ’em, in the
grave!”</p>

<p>“The lying-in room, I suppose, that means?”
said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger’s
excited description.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the stranger. “A boy was born
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“A many boys,” observed Mr. Bumble,
shaking his head, despondingly.</p>

<p>“A murrain on the young devils!” cried the
stranger, impatiently; “I speak of one, a meek-looking,
pale-faced hound, who was apprenticed
down here to a coffin-maker, (I wish he had
made his coffin, and screwed his body in it,) and
who afterwards ran away to London, as it was
supposed.”</p>

<p>“Why, you mean Oliver—young Twist?”
said Mr. Bumble; “I remember him, of course.
There wasn’t a obstinater young rascal——”</p>

<p>“It’s not of him I want to hear; I’ve heard
enough of him,” said the stranger, stopping Mr.
Bumble in the very outset of a tirade on the
subject of poor Oliver’s vices. “It’s of a
woman, the hag that nursed his mother. Where
is she?”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” said Mr. Bumble, whom
the gin-and-water had rendered facetious. “It
would be hard to tell. There’s no midwifery
there, whichever place she’s gone to; so I
suppose she’s out of employment any way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded the stranger,
sternly.</p>

<p>“That she died last winter,” rejoined Mr.
Bumble.</p>

<p>The man looked fixedly at him when he had
given this information, and although he did not
withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his
gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted,
and he seemed lost in thought. For some time,
he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be
relieved or disappointed by the intelligence, but
at length he breathed more freely, and withdrawing
his eyes, observed that it was no great
matter, and rose as if to depart.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble was cunning enough, and he at
once saw that an opportunity was opened for
the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession
of his better half. He well remembered
the night of old Sally’s death, which the
occurrences of that day had given him good
reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he
had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although
that lady had never confided to him the disclosure
of which she had been the solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
witness, he had heard enough to know that it
related to something that had occurred in the
old woman’s attendance, as workhouse nurse,
upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily
calling this circumstance to mind, he informed
the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one
woman had been closeted with the old harridan
shortly before she died, and that she could, as
he had reason to believe, throw some light on
the subject of his inquiry.</p>

<p>“How can I find her?” said the stranger,
thrown off his guard, and plainly shewing that
all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused
afresh by the intelligence.</p>

<p>“Only through me,” rejoined Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>“When?” cried the stranger, hastily.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” rejoined Bumble.</p>

<p>“At nine in the evening,” said the stranger,
producing a scrap of paper, and writing down
an obscure address by the water-side upon it, in
characters that betrayed his agitation; “at nine
in the evening, bring her to me there. I
